<h2>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> following unscientific monograph, a sort of
little historical descant, is founded upon all the
accurate known literature of the subject, and also
largely on the Hardwicke MSS. These, in so far
as they relate to Emmet, the writer was first to
consult and have copied, last winter, before they
were catalogued. But while these sheets were in
press, several interesting fragments from the MSS.
appeared in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> for September,
1903, thus forestalling their present use. This
discovery will condone the writer’s innocent claim,
made on page 60, of printing the two letters there
as unpublished matter.</p>

<p>The portrait is after Brocas’s hurried court-room
sketch, made the day before the execution.
The original print is in the Joly Collection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
National Library of Ireland. The head is too sharp
and narrow, and yet it bears a marked resemblance,
far exceeding that of either of the other portraits,
to some of Robert Emmet’s collateral descendants.
On such good <i>à posteriori</i> evidence it was chosen.</p>

<h2>ROBERT EMMET<br />

<small>A SURVEY OF HIS REBELLION AND OF
HIS ROMANCE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> four who lived to grow up of the seventeen
children born to Robert Emmet, M.D., of Cork,
later of Dublin, and Elizabeth Mason, his wife,
were all, in their way, persons of genius. The
Emmets were of Anglo-Norman stock, Protestants,
settled for centuries in Ireland. The Masons, of like
English origin, had merged it in repeated alliances
with women of Kerry, where the Dane, the Norman,
and later invaders from nearer quarters had never
settled down to perturb the ancient Celtic social
stream. Dr. Emmet was a man of clear brain and
incorruptible honour. The mother of his children,
to judge by her letters, many of which have been
privately printed, must have been an exquisite
being, high-minded, religious, loving, humorous,
wise. Her eldest surviving son, Christopher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Temple Emmet, was named for his two paternal
grandparents, Christopher Emmet of Tipperary
and Rebecca Temple, great-great-granddaughter of
the first Baronet Temple of Stowe, in Buckinghamshire.
The mention of that prolific, wide-branching,
and extraordinary family of Temple as
forebears of the younger Emmets is like a sharply
accented note in a musical measure. It has never
been played for what it is worth; no annalist has
tracked certain Emmet qualities to this perfectly
obvious ancestral source. The Temples had not
only, in this case, the bygone responsibility to bear,
for in a marked manner they kept on influencing
their Emmet contemporaries, as in one
continuous mood thought engenders thought.
Says Mr. James Hannay: “The distinctive ηθος
of the Temples has been a union of more than
usual of the kind of talent which makes men of
letters, with more than usual of the kind of talent
which makes men of affairs.” The Emmets, too,
shared the “distinctive ηθος” in the highest degree.
Added to the restless two-winged intelligence, they
had the heightened soberness, the moral elevation,
which formed no separate inheritance. The
Temples were, and are, a race of subtle but somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
austere imagination, strongly inclined to
republicanism, and to that individualism which is
the norm of it. The Temple influence in eighteenth-century
Ireland was, obliquely, the American influence:
a new and heady draught at that time, a
“draught of intellectual day.” If we seek for
those unseen agencies which are so much more
operative than mere descent, we cover a good deal
of ground in remembering that Robert Emmet the
patriot came of the same blood as Sidney’s friend,
Cromwell’s chaplain, and Dorothy Osborne’s leal
and philosophic husband. And he shared not only
the Temple idiosyncrasy, but, unlike his remarkable
brothers, the thin, dark, aquiline Temple face.</p>

<p>Rebecca Temple, only daughter of Thomas, a
baronet’s son, married Christopher Emmet in 1727,
brought the dynastic names, Robert and Thomas,
into the Emmet family, and lived in the house
of her son, the Dublin physician, until her death in
1774, when her grandchildren, Temple and Thomas
Addis, were aged thirteen and ten, Robert being
yet unborn. Her protracted life and genial character
would have strengthened the relations, always close,
with the Temple kin. Her brother Robert had
gone in his youth from Ireland to Boston, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
his father was long resident; and there he married
a Temple cousin. This Captain Robert Temple
died on April 13, 1754, “at his seat, Ten Hills,
at Boston, in New England.” His three sons,
the eldest of whom, succeeding his great-grandfather,
became afterwards Sir John Temple, eighth
Baronet of Stowe, all settled in New England and
married daughters of the Bowdoin, Shirley, and
Whipple families—good wives and clever women.
John Temple had been “a thorough Whig all
through the Revolution,” and had suffered magnanimously
for it. He had to forfeit office, vogue,
and money; and little anticipating his then most
improbable chances of a rise in the world, he forfeited
all these with dogged cheerfulness, in the
hour when he could least afford to do so. The
latter-day Winthrops of the Republic are directly
descended from him, and the late Marquis of
Dufferin and Ava from his brother. A certain
victorious free spirit, an intellectual fire, whimsical
and masterful, has touched the whole race
of untamable Temples, and the Emmets, the
very flower of that race. Love of liberty
was, in both Robert Emmet and in Thomas
Addis Emmet, no isolated phenomenon, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
their strengthened and applied inheritance. Captain
Robert Temple’s second son, Robert, came
back with his wife, Harriet Shirley, after the
Declaration of Independence, to Allentown, Co.
Dublin. His widow eventually received indemnification
for the loss of their transatlantic estates.
It is thus proved that Robert Temple was a loyalist
to some appreciable degree. Earlier and later,
however, he did considerable thinking, cherished
liberal principles, and had much to say of the
rights of man and other large theses to his namesake
first cousin, Robert Emmet, M.D., with whom
he lived for eighteen months after his return.
This community of ideas was further cemented
by the marriage of Anne Western Temple, Robert
Temple’s daughter, to Dr. Emmet’s eldest son,
Temple Emmet. Dr. Emmet was faithful to
the unpopular convictions which he found himself
sharing in increased degree with his cousin. Up
to 1783 he was always voluntarily abandoning one
position of eminence after another, as he came to
dissent from English rule in Ireland. He held
among other offices that of State Physician; and
from a bland condemnatory notice of his youngest
son in <i>The Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for October 1803,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
we learn that he was also physician to the Lord-Lieutenant’s
household. It is clear, then, that he
also began his career as a trusted Conservative.
But as his opinions changed, he gave up, Temple-like
and Emmet-like, every position and emolument
inconsistent with them; when the ’98 broke out
he had even ceased to practise his profession.
He and his wife and their children felt alike in
these matters so adversely and intimately affecting
their chances of worldly success. The boys and
the girl were brought up to think first of Ireland
and her needs. An amicable satirist and distinguished
acquaintance was wont facetiously to
report Dr. Emmet’s administration of what the
visitor named “the morning draught” to his little
ones: “Well, Temple, what are you ready to do
for your country? Would you kill your sister?
Would you kill me?” For after this perilous early
Roman pattern the catechism ran. Even if only a
beloved joke, it would have been enough to seal
the young Emmets for fanaticism, had not their
good angels intervened. As it turned out, they
were all of a singularly judicial cast. The only
daughter, Mary Anne, had what used to be called,
by way of adequate eulogy, a “masculine understanding,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and wrote pertinently and well. Her
husband was the celebrated barrister and devoted
Irishman, Robert Holmes. He was the true friend
and adviser of the whole Emmet family, and survived
his wife, who died during his imprisonment
in 1804, for five-and-fifty years. Of Dr. Emmet’s
three sons, Temple, Thomas Addis, and Robert,
the former had an almost incomparably high
repute for “every virtue, every grace,” to quote
Landor’s mourning line for another. It is no disparagement
to him to say that this was partly owing
to the pathos of so short a career, and to the fact
that he died ten years before the great Insurrection,
twelve before the Union; seeming to belong to a
prior order of things, it was the easier to praise the
Emmet who did not live long enough to get into
trouble, at the expense of the Emmets who did.</p>

<p>Temple Emmet, with his beautiful thought-burdened
head, a little like the young Burke’s,
passed by like a wonderful apparition in his day.
His success at Trinity College was complete; it is
said the examiners found their usual maximum of
commendation, <i>Valde bene</i>, unequal to the occasion,
and had a special <i>O quam bene!</i> given to him with
his degree. This has a sort of historic parallel in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the incident at Wadham College, Oxford, just a
century before, when Clarendon, Lord Chancellor
of the University, set a kiss for eulogy upon the
boyish cheek of John Wilmot, Master of Arts.
Again serving as his own precedent, Temple
Emmet became King’s Counsel at twenty-five.
Two years later he was in his grave, whither his
young wife quickly followed him. All his contemporaries
qualified to appraise his worth, deplored
him beyond common measure. Said the great
Grattan, long after: “Temple Emmet, before he
came to the Bar, knew more law than any of the
judges on the Bench; and if he had been placed
on one side and the whole Bench opposed to him,
he could have been examined against them, and
would have surpassed them all; he would have
answered better both in law and divinity than any
judge or bishop in the land.” His premature
death called his next brother from the University
of Glasgow, where he had just graduated in medicine,
to the profession of the law.</p>

<p>The Emmet name was not destined to rise like a
star where it had fallen, for bitter times were drawing
nigh, and his own generosity and integrity were
to bring Thomas Addis Emmet into fatal difficulties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
With a great number of other zealous spirits, he
flung himself with all his force of protest against the
legalised iniquities destroying Ireland. Examined
before the secret committee of the House of Lords,
August 10, 1798, the young man, then as always
quietly intrepid, let fall brave prophetic words.
Asked if he had been an United Irishman, he
righted the tense in answering: “My Lords, I am
one”; then he continued: “Give me leave to tell
you, my Lords, that if the Government of this
country be not regulated so that the control may
be wholly Irish, and that the commercial arrangements
between the two countries be not put upon
a footing of perfect equality, the connection [with
England] cannot last.” Lord Glentworth said:
“Then your intention was to destroy the Church?”
Mr. Emmet replied: “No, my Lord, my intention
never was to destroy the Church. My wish decidedly
was to overturn the Establishment.” Here
Lord Dillon interrupted: “I understand you. And
have it as it is in France?” “As it is in America,
my Lords.” When the chance for self-expatriation
came, when “to retract was impossible, to proceed
was death,” Thomas Addis Emmet followed the
ancestral trail, and founded a new family in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
approved America. The only one of his circle
spared to continue the Emmet name, he came to
flower sadly enough, because his hopes were broken,
on what was not to him alien soil. Everyone knows
the rest: how, admitted to the New York Bar by
suspension of rules, without probation, he died in
all men’s honour, in 1827, Attorney-General of the
State.</p>

<p>Robert Emmet was even surer of an illustrious
career. Alas! There is no documentary proof
forthcoming for it as yet, but it is painfully probable
that his little afterglow of a rebellion was
long fostered, for reasons of their own, by great
statesmen, and that their secret knowledge of it
arose from Irish bad faith; that, in short, he was
let dream his dream until it suited others to close
the toils about him. The two or three highest in
authority in Dublin, Lord Hardwicke chief among
them, were kept ignorant as himself. Emmet was
really victim and martyr. But to die prodigally at
twenty-five, and to be enshrined with unwithered
and unique passion in Irish hearts; to go down prematurely
in dust and blood, and yet to be understood,
felt, seen, for ever, in the sphere where “only
the great things last,” is perhaps as enviable a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
privilege as young men often attain. His is one
of several historic instances in which those who
have wrought little else seem to have wrought
an exquisite and quite enduring image of themselves
in human tradition. With none of the
celebrities of his own nation can he in point of
actual service, compare; but every one of them,
whether known to ancient folk-lore or to the
printed annals of yesterday, is less of a living
legend with Thierry’s “long-memoried people,”
than “the youngest and last of the United Irishmen,”
“the child of the heart of Ireland.” A
knot of peasants gathered around a peat fire in
the long evenings, pipe in hand, are the busy hereditary
factors of apocryphal tales beginning “Once
Robert Emmet (God love him),” &amp;c.; and a certain
coloured print, very green as to raiment, very melodramatic
as to gesture, hangs to-day in the best
room of their every cabin, and stands to them for
all that was of old, and is not, and still should be.</p>

<p>He was born March 4, 1778, in his father’s
house in St. Stephen Green West, Dublin, now
numbered 124-125. As a boy he was active out
of doors, yet full of insatiable interest in books,
and developed early his charming talent for drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and modelling. He was always rather grave
than gay; but the best proof, if any were needed,
that he had nothing of the prig in him, is that he
was a favourite at school; the potential Great Man,
in fact, to whom the others looked up. His one
serious early illness was small-pox, which left his
complexion slightly roughened. He entered Trinity
College, in his native city, at fifteen. Either at
this time, or just before, occurred an incident so
characteristic as to be worth recording, for it illustrates
both his power of mental concentration, and
his still courage in facing the untoward haps of life
alone. Like Shelley, he had a youthful fascination
for chemistry. He had been dabbling with corrosive
sublimate, not long before bedtime. Instead
of going upstairs, he sat down, later, to figure out
an allotted algebraic problem which, by way of
whetting adventurous spirits, the author of the
book in question acknowledged to be extremely
difficult. Poring earnestly over the page, the boy
fell to biting his nails. He instantly tasted poison,
and pain and fear rushed on him. Without rousing
a single person from sleep, he ran to the library,
got down his father’s encyclopædia, turned to the
article he needed, and learned that his antidote was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
chalk and water; then he went in the dark to the
coach-house where he had seen chalk used, got it,
mixed and drank it, and returned to his interrupted
task. His tutor could not fail to notice the agonised
little face at breakfast. Robert confessed the
mischance, and that he had lain perforce awake all
night; but he added, modestly, that he had mastered
the problem. One of Plutarch’s heroes, at that
age, could hardly have done better. The antique
world, with its heroic simpleness, was indeed
Robert Emmet’s own ground. At Trinity he
earned, without effort, a golden reputation, partly
due to his scientific scholarship, partly to his goodness,
partly, again, to his possession of a faculty
of animated fluent speech, a faculty dear to the
Irish, as to every primitive people. He had a
presence noticeably sweet and winning, with “that
gentleness so often found in determined spirits.”
His classmate, Moore, the poet, bore witness
long after to his “pure moral worth combined
with intellectual power.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Emmet was wholly
free from the follies and frailties of youth, though
how capable he was of the most devoted passion
events afterwards proved.” Mr. Charles Phillips
wrote in 1818: “[Emmet at Trinity] was gifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
with abilities and virtues which rendered him an
object of universal esteem and admiration. Every
one loved, every one respected him; his fate made
an impression on the University which has not yet
been obliterated. His mind was naturally melancholy
and romantic: he had fed it from the pure
fountain of classic literature, and might be said to
have lived not so much in the scene around him as
in the society of the illustrious and sainted dead.
The poets of antiquity were his companions, its
patriots his models, and its republics his admiration.
He had but just entered upon the world, full of the
ardour which such studies might be supposed to
have excited, and unhappily at a period in the
history of his country when such noble feelings were
not only detrimental but dangerous.”</p>

<p>When Emmet was in his twentieth year the so-called
Rebellion, in which Wolfe Tone and Lord
Edward Fitzgerald were leaders, broke out. In
the agitation which led up to it and sustained it,
Thomas Addis Emmet was deeply implicated, nor
did his younger brother go unsinged by the travelling
flame. Sitting once by the pianoforte in
Thomas Moore’s rooms, listening to <i>Let Erin
Remember</i>, he stood up suddenly, with a brief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
pregnant speech, such as was habitual with him:
“O that I were at the head of twenty thousand
men, marching to that air!” As it was, he made
one of the nineteen of her best spirits whom his
University then thought fit to dismiss without benisons.
One of these was no fiery undergraduate, but
a Fellow and a famous scholar, Dr. Whitley Stokes.
Their chief offence was that they had refused to tell
what they knew of others who shared their outspoken
opinions. There is no need here to dwell
upon the memorable rising of 1798, or upon the
rooted general opposition to that Union with Great
Britain which wholesale bribery was so soon to consummate.
One need but bear in mind that the
Anglo-Irish (chiefly the Presbyterians and members
of the dominant Church, the landed classes, who
had nothing to gain and everything to lose by their
championship of disenfranchised Catholics and the
countless poor) came angrily to the fore as the
defenders of nationalism, at a time when exile, the
dungeon, and the axe, active for two generations,
had deprived Ireland of the last of her native
Jacobite gentry. Saurin, the great jurist, had
written: “Whether it would be prudent in the
people to avail themselves of that right would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
another question; but if a Legislative Union were
forced on the country against the will of its inhabitants,
it would be a nullity: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [To take issue
with it] would be a struggle against usurpation, not
resistance against law.” Emmet had only to cross
the street from his College to hear the debates in
either House of Parliament, to hear the like doctrine
from Grattan in his glory; and with “malignants”
of the loftiest character, like Lord Cloncurry,
then the Rt. Hon. Valentine Lawless, he and his
associated every day. It was inevitable, with such
counsels of perfection brought to bear upon his daring
and his entire disinterestedness, that Robert Emmet
should attempt a popular emancipation, and succeed
but in ruining himself. It was a poignant case of
chronological and topographical misplacement. In
his expulsion, or rather, withdrawal from College
(for he had anticipated the action of the authorities),
his father, of course, approved and stood by him,
although Robert’s entry upon any professional career
was fatally compromised. His “highly distinguished
family, striking talents, and interesting
manners,” could not mend that. He may even
have taken at once the plain godly oath of the United
Irishmen, and become an active agent for the cause.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Within the twelvemonth he had bestirred himself
so effectually that a warrant was actually issued for
his arrest. For some reason or other it was not put
in force: even thus early there began to be woven
about him the web of curious cross-purposes in
which, in the end, he was to be caught and strangled.
It became advisable to go to France, to see the
First Consul and Talleyrand on an all-important
matter. It would be well to reach a quiet place
beyond espionage, where inhibited rites might go
on. The young conspirator had military histories
in process of annotation, plans of campaign in
mountainous districts to perfect, seditious conferences
to hold with colleagues and subordinates,
and, incidentally, even poems to commit for his
sad country’s sake. And there was another excellent
reason why he found it convenient to go
away.</p>

<p>One of Robert Emmet’s college mates was
Richard, youngest son of the John Philpot Curran,
“ugly, copious, full of wit and ardour and fire,” the
Curran of “fifty faces and twice as many voices,”
of Byron’s lasting admiration. Richard had a
sister Sarah, aged not quite eighteen when Robert
Emmet, three years her senior, fell in love with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
her. Sentimental invention has placed their first
meeting at a ball in a Wicklow country-house;
but it would rather seem as if, in the compact
society of a gay little city like Dublin before the
Union, they must have known each other fairly well
from childhood, especially as the two families were
then acquainted. That fatal mutual affection was
to endure long vicissitudes and to prove invincible.</p>

<p>We must infer from a passage in Mr. W. H.
Curran’s <i>Life</i> of his father that Emmet’s reserve, for
once, but imperfectly concealed evidences of some
strong passion, political or extra-political, or both,
from the oracular host of the Priory at Rathfarnham.
Parenthetically, and without emphasis, Mr. Curran
saw fit to warn his household against too implicit a
cherishing of their engaging visitor. That Sarah’s
interest in him was particular, that it was already
awakened and deepening, seems never to have
been surmised. According to such evidence as
we have, it looks as though he had declared to
her the state of his feelings before he went to Paris.
It was not an hour, however, when Sarah dared to be
happy. Her family had but just gathered together
after a most harrowing break-up; she herself had
been away for several years under the roof of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
beloved clergyman in Lismore, and her homecoming
was recent. Her mother, how driven to
that point of revolt we know not, had eloped in
1794 with a too sympathetic neighbouring vicar.
Sarah was fourteen then, and of a peculiarly sensitive
temperament; and she had worshipped her mother.
Her sensitiveness was not allayed by her father’s
increased mental aloofness from his family, after his
misfortune. Incomparably genial, when he chose, to
strangers, he visited his resentments in private upon
his children, her children, especially upon his son
Henry, who stood in lifelong dread of him. The
one little daughter of his inordinate love, Gertrude,
had died by accident at twelve years old.</p>

<p>Sarah’s sad young face was typically Irish, her
noble and touching beauty stamped in every feature
with irony, melancholy, and fatalism. To her lover,
with his head full of all poetic ideas, she must
have looked like the very spirit of Innisfail. His
intensely sanguine and resolute nature may have
kept him from reading in such a face their own
common rune of sorrow. It is clear that his forgetting
her, while he was absorbed in the grave business
abroad, was out of the question. No one knows, he
tells Mme. la Marquise de Fontenay, in one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
few recovered letters, what his return to Ireland and
to “the sorrows before him” is costing. Memories
of the past (of that long-distanced past which is
proper to blasted youth) must assail him; and it
will be hard to affect that he has not known “tender
ties, perhaps,” which he is forbidden to resume. The
lad was writing in French, and does it in character.
But then, as ever, he was radically sincere. His
thoughts seem to have turned towards Dublin,
from motives of filial duty. His father and mother
had agreed to the elder brother’s first suggestion
from Paris that Robert should be induced to go to
America with him; and Robert felt that so generous
a permission laid its own obligation on him not to
accept the parting. Everything seemed to conspire
to restore him to Ireland. And with his yet-to-be-liberated
Ireland, like</p>

<p class="center">
“Flame on flame and wing on wing,”<br />
</p>

<p class="unindent">shone the remote sweetness of Sarah Curran. He
was told that revolutionary hopes were ripening
fast; he was thus lured back in October, 1802. His
absence had lasted nearly three years.</p>

<p>The separation had probably taught Sarah something
more of her own heart. Immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Emmet’s visits to the Priory were resumed, as if in
the general stream of homage which brought so
many enthusiastic young men into Mr. Curran’s
presence, at evening, to listen and gather wisdom.
Dr. Emmet died in April, much lamented, and by
his will Robert came into possession of considerable
ready money. He spent it instantly, effectively,
and entirely on preparations for armed resistance.
No one suspected it; those in his confidence were
yet faithful. Still less did others suspect the now
plighted attachment, the innocent love hungry for
joy, and yet hurried on to dark ends through
devious and hidden ways. Mr. Curran’s strenuous
opposition, on all grounds, was necessarily taken for
granted, until some prodigious success should befall
Emmet, and as if by a spell free the daughter who
so feared her father. Sarah knew detail by detail of
the conspiracy as it arose, and was fain with all her
soul to encourage its progress. For the two sensitive
creatures under so complicated a strain there passed
an anxious and exciting year. The most disagreeable
surprise of Mr. Curran’s life was yet to come
before it ended.</p>

<p>Robert Emmet took lodgings under an assumed
name in Butterfield Lane, in the suburb of Rathfarnham.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
His agents came to him by night and reported
their progress. The record of all he had meant to
do, drawn up with manly composure at the brink of
the grave, may be read elsewhere. As has been
noted, his plan for the capture of Dublin and the
summoning of the patriotic Members of Parliament
was clearly founded on an inspiring precedent,
that of the Revolution of 1640 in Portugal,
when but two-score clever and resolute men served
to deliver the whole country from the yoke of
Spain. But when the hour of Ireland’s destiny
struck, every clock-wheel went wrong. If the failure
were not so piteous, because of one’s interest in the
doomed wizard and his suddenly disenchanted wand,
it would be grotesque. Emmet had studied with
enormous industry, and arranged with masterly precision,
directing, among pikes and powder in his
dingy depôts, each needful move and counter-move
for a concerted rising; he thought it strange that
in every conceivable way, major and minor, the whole
scheme simultaneously miscarried.</p>

<p>If one could believe him as free as he believed
himself, one might regret that he maintained too
perfect a secrecy, and counted too much upon
the elasticity of Irish impulse. He had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
careful to avoid what he thought the error of the
United Irishmen in establishing too many posts
for revolutionary action, and confiding knowledge
of preliminaries to innumerable persons all over
the country, some of whom would be almost
certain to play him false. He worked in the
dark, with but a dozen friends at his elbow,
spending his money freely but heedfully on manufacturing
and storing weapons of war in Dublin.
He looked towards a moment when a disaffected
legion would arise at a summons, like the men
from the heath in <i>The Lady of the Lake:</i> a legion
which he could arm and command and weld, in
one magic moment, for Ireland’s regeneration. He
leaned overmuch, not on human goodness, but on
human intelligence in making opportunity: and it
failed him. He was like the purely literary playwright
labouring with the average theatre audience;
he was never in the least, for all his wit, cunning
enough to deal scientifically with a corporation on
whom hints, half-tones, adumbrations, are thrown
away; the law of whose being is still to crave a
presentation of the “undisputed thing in such a
solemn way.” As drama through its processes, act
after act, does well to assume that we are all blockheads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and then, as the case requires, to modify,
so any flaming revolutionary genius would do well
to trust nothing whatever to a moral inspiration
only too likely to be non-existent. It is a terribly
costly thing to be, as we say, equal to an emergency,
before the emergency is quite ready to be equalled.
And that was Emmet’s plight. A French fleet had
been promised to begin military operations towards
the end of August, but an unforeseen explosion in one
of Emmet’s Dublin magazines led him to declare
his toy war against the English Crown prematurely.
The local volunteer troops were to be reinforced by
others, well armed, from the outlying counties, at
the firing of a rocket agreed upon; the Castle was
to be seized as the chief move, and a Provisional
Government, according to printed programme, set
up. The time for assembling was hurriedly fixed
for July 23, 1803, early in the evening. The gentlemen
leaders and the trusty battalions failed to appear,
kept away by mysterious quasi-authentic advices;
appeared instead, as time wore on, many unknown,
unprepossessing insurgents, the drunken refuse of the
city taverns. The cramp-irons, the scaling-ladders,
the blunderbusses, the fuses for the grenades, were not
ready; signals had been delayed or suppressed; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
prepared slow-matches were mixed in with others;
treachery was at work and running like fire in oil
under the eyes of one who could believe no ill of
human kind. Beyond Dublin, the Wicklow men
under Dwyer, an epic peasant figure, received no
message; the Wexford men waited in vain for
orders all night; the Kildare men, whom Emmet
meant to head in person, actually reached the city,
and left it again. They had met and talked with
him, and were not satisfied with the number and
quality of the weapons, chiefly primitive inventions
of his own; and because Dublin confederates were
not produced for inspection (such was Emmet’s
caution where others were concerned), the canny
farmers returned homewards, spreading the ill word
along the roads that Dublin had refused to act.
Each imaginable prospect grew darker than its
alternative. But the curtain had to rise now,
let results be what they might. About nine o’clock,
Emmet being in such a state of speechless agitation
as may be conceived, one Quigley rushed in with
the false report that the Government soldiery were
upon them. There was nothing to do but sally
forth in the hope of augmented numbers, once the
move was made. The poor “General,” in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
green-and-white-and-gold uniform, at the head of
some eighty insubordinates, took in the bitter situation
at a glance: he foresaw how his holy insurrection
would dwindle to a three-hours’ riot, how his
dream, with all its costly architecture, was ending
like snow in the gutter. Hardly had he set out
on foot, with drawn sword, through the town,
accompanied by the faithful Stafford and two or
three associates, followed confusedly by the uncontrollable
crowd, when an uproar rose from the
rear; there was a sudden commotion which ended
in wounds and death to a citizen and an officer;
then the spirit of rowdyism, private pillage, and
indiscriminate slaughter took the lead. While it
ran high, Arthur Wolfe, Lord Kilwarden, Lord
Chief-Justice, the one unfailingly humane and deservedly
beloved judge in all Ireland, was killed.
He was driving in from the country with his
daughter and his nephew, the Rev. Richard Wolfe;
finding the carriage stopped in Thomas Street, he
put his grey head out at the window in the pleasant
evening light, announcing the honoured name which,
as he thought he knew, would be his passport
through the maddest mob ever gathered. A muddle-brained
creature, quite mistaken as to facts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
acting in revenge for a wrong never inflicted, unmercifully
piked him: a fate paralleled only by the
unpremeditated assassination in our own time of
that other kindest heart, Lord Frederick Cavendish.
It is significant that some in the ranks afterwards
made separately in court the unasked declaration
that had they been near enough, Lord Kilwarden’s
life should have been saved at the expense of their
own. Such, indeed, was the general feeling. It
has been carelessly stated that Emmet was not far
from the scene of the outrage, and arrived, in a
fury, just too late to prevent the second horror,
the stabbing to death of Mr. Wolfe; and that it
was he who took the unfortunate Miss Wolfe, to
whom no violence was offered, from the carriage.
But records now show conclusively that (as he
once said) he had withdrawn from that part of
Dublin before the murders came to pass. He had
addressed his followers in Francis Street, setting his
face against useless bloodshed, and made for the
mountains hard by, commanding those who retained
any sense of discipline to go along with him.
A quick retreat was the only sagacious course to
follow in this gross witless turmoil, so contrary to
his purpose: for his printed manifesto had expressly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
declared life and property were to be held sacred.
His secret, up to this point, was practically safe,
and his losses reparable. The “rebels” abroad
that night were but diabolical changelings; he
would break away with the few he could rely
upon, nurse hope to life with the courage that
never failed, and take his chances to fight again.
He reached safety, unchallenged; Dwyer even then
implored for leave to call out on the morrow his
disappointed veterans for a new assay; but Emmet
was firm. No lust of revenge on fate, no recoil from
being thought, for one hot moment, a coward, could
shake him from his shrewd and rational acceptance
of present defeat. He had no personal ambition,
no vicarious tax to pay it. Ireland could wait the
truer hour. He seems never once to have bewailed
aloud the miserable end of his own long minute
study of military strategy, the foul check to aspirations
founded in honour, and breathed upon by the
dead of Salamis and Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>It is an almost incredible fact that the authorities,
meanwhile, whether aware or unaware of the projected
outbreak, were virtually off their guard, and
the garrison was so little in condition to repel an
onset that not a ball in the arsenal would fit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
artillery! Public attention in Great Britain was
fixed on the difficulties with France, and this preoccupation
everywhere affected social life. Dublin
had been almost deserted on July 23; the Castle
gates stood wide open, without sentries. Two
entire hours passed before the detachments of horse
and foot arrived to clear the streets. “Government
escaped by a sort of miracle,” as <i>The Nation</i>
remarked half a century after, “by a series of
accidents and mistakes no human sagacity could
have foreseen, and no skill repair.” Though there
was treachery behind and before as we now see,
Emmet, mournfully closing his summary of events,
took no account of it. “Had I another week [of
privacy], had I one thousand pounds, had I one
thousand men, I would have feared nothing.
There was redundancy enough in any one part to
have made up in completeness for deficiency in the
rest. But there was failure in all: plan, preparation,
and men.” Three days after the abortive
rising, the disturbance was completely over and
the country everywhere quiet. The whole number
of the slain was under fifty.</p>

<p>None among those who have written of Robert
Emmet have noted for what reason the news of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the death of Lord Kilwarden must have been to
him a last desperate blow. Quite apart from his
natural horror of the blundering crime, he had the
most intimate cause to lament it. Lord Kilwarden
was the person in all the world whom John Philpot
Curran most revered: “my guardian angel,” he
was wont to call him, summing up in the words all
his tutelary service of long years to a junior colleague.
It would have gone hard with Mr. Curran,
so high was partisan passion at the time, if, in his
defence of the State prisoners during the terrible
series of prosecutions in the ’98, he had not been
protected, day after day, by the strong influence of
Kilwarden. Emmet, if he could have leaned for
once on a merely selfish motive, might have looked
forward, as to the blackness of hell, to that hour
when Curran should learn that his dearest friend’s
indirect murderer was none other than his daughter’s
betrothed lover. Apprehensions of danger to his
sweetheart must have haunted Robert Emmet
through the sleepless nights among the outlawed
folk on the wild fragrant Wicklow hillsides.
Below, in a little port, was a fishing-smack under
full sail, which meant liberty and security, would
he but abandon all and come away. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
insistent beat of his own heart was to see his
beautiful Sarah again; to learn how she looked
upon him, or whether she would fly with him now
that his first great endeavour was over, and only the
rag of a pure motive was left to clothe his soiled
dream and his abject undoing. It was a mad deed;
but Robert Emmet, in relics of his tarnished regimentals,
stole back to Dublin. He was so young
that the adventure took on multiple attractions.</p>

<p>He hid himself in a house at Harold’s Cross,
where he had masqueraded once before, when his
country’s need constrained him. Now he was
there chiefly because the road in front ran towards
Rathfarnham, and because, at least, he could sometime
or other watch his own dear love go by. A
servant, a peasant wench who was devoted to him,
Anne Devlin, carried letters under her apron to the
Priory, carried letters “richer than Ind” back to
the proscribed master. She was a neighbouring
dairyman’s daughter, and her coming and going
were unquestioned. Forty years after, in her
pathetic old age, she told Dr. Madden how Miss
Sarah’s emotion would all but betray her: “When
I handed her a letter, her face would change so, one
would hardly know her.” And again: “Miss Sarah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
was not tall, her figure was very slight, her complexion
dark, her eyes large and black, and her look
was the mildest, the softest, and the sweetest look
you ever saw!” All this is beautifully borne out
by the Romney portrait, save that the pensive face
which Romney must have begun to paint before the
time of her betrothal (for after 1799 he painted
hardly at all) is not olive-skinned and not black-eyed.
The eyes are, in truth, very dark, but of
Irish violet-grey. Every Anne Devlin in the world
would have called them “black.” But one hastens
to contradict a hasty phrase: there is but one Anne
Devlin, a soul beyond price, who suffered afterwards
and without capitulation, for her “Mr.
Robert’s” sake, tortures of body and mind which
read like those in the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>. Her name
will be with his when that “country shall have taken
her place among the nations of the earth;” until then
there is no fear but that those who care for him will
keep a little candle burning to his most heroic friend.</p>

<p>At every house where Emmet lived, as “Mr.
Huet” or “Mr. Ellis,” during his fugitive and
perilous months, he had his romantic trap-doors,
and removable wainscots, and sliding panels. Even
at Casino, his own home in the country, closed after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
his father’s death, with its summer-house and decaying
garden, he provided like subterfuges and
inventions of his own, for he had a turn for mechanism
as well as for the plastic arts. It is hard to be
both a hunted rebel and an anxious lover, to have
equal necessity for staying in and for sallying forth!
Just so had “Lord Edward,” dear to every one who
knew him, managed to exist, in and out of a hole,
before his seizure and death. It has been justly
said that “a system of government which could
reduce such men as Robert Emmet and Lord
Edward Fitzgerald to live the life of conspirators,
and die the death of traitors, is condemned by that
alone.” It seems hardly possible but that Robert
and his Sarah made out to meet again, as they had
met after the lamentable no-rising, when for a night
and a morning he had lingered in the alarmed city
before escaping into the mountains. One may be
not far wrong in believing that the girl was by this
time too overwrought, dismayed, and grief-stricken,
to come to any immediate decision about joining
him, and breaking away while there was yet opportunity.
He must have realised fully the alternative,
whether she did so or not, that to remain in Ireland
was but to beckon on his fate. At any rate, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
August 23, at his humble dining-table, he was
suddenly apprehended. The informer has never
been discovered; from the Secret Service Money
books we know that he received his due £1000.
The captor was Major Sirr, the unloved fowler of
that other young eagle of insurrection but just mentioned,
Lord Edward Fitzgerald. He was able to
recognise Emmet by the retrospective description
obligingly furnished by Dr. Elrington, Provost of
Trinity, of an undergraduate whom he had not loved.
The captive was bound and led away, bleeding from
a pistol wound in the shoulder. He had tried to get
off, and some rough treatment followed, for which
apologies were tendered. “All is fair in war,” said
the prince of courtesy. The Earl of Hardwicke,
then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, writes two days
after, in his usual covertly kind way, of the arrest
of young Emmet, now consigned to Kilmainham
Gaol on the charge of high treason. “I confess I
had imagined that he had escaped,” he says to his
brother, his confidential daily correspondent. “His
having remained here looks as if he had been in expectation
of a further attempt.” Not yet was the
Lord Lieutenant aware of the love-story intertwined
with the one-man insurrection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>When enclosed in his cell, Emmet became the
object of apparent concern and affection on the
part of two acquaintances: the accomplished advocate
and litterateur, Mr. Leonard M’Nally, and Dr.
Trevor, Superintendent of Prisons. If these persons
had stepped out of an ancient epic or some fancied
tragedy to show what human genius could do by
way of creating hypocrites, no plaudit ever yet given
could be worthy of the play. They were both moral
monsters, paragons of evil, beyond the Florentine or
Elizabethan imagination. How they played with
the too noble and trusting creature in their hands,
how they tricked him with illusory plans of escape,
and beguiled him into inditing documents which
were promptly handed over to headquarters, need
not detain us, though it supplies a long thrilling
chapter in the humanities. Emmet’s first move was
to empty his pockets of coin for the gaoler, under
the man’s promise that he would carry in person a
communication to Miss Curran. The recipient was
not that distracted maid, but the Attorney-General.
The Lord Lieutenant wrote to the Hon. Charles
Yorke on September 9 as follows: “A curious
discovery has been made respecting Emmet, the
particulars of which I have not time to detail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
you fully. There were found upon him two letters
from a woman, written with a knowledge of the
transactions in which he had been engaged, and
with good wishes for the success of any future
attempt. He has been very anxious to prevent
these letters being brought forward, and has been
apprehensive that the writer was arrested as well as
himself. Till yesterday, however, we were entirely
ignorant of the person who had written these letters,
which are very clever and striking. The discovery
was made last night by a letter from Emmet, intercepted
on its passage from Kilmainham Prison to
Miss Sarah Curran, youngest daughter of Curran
the lawyer. Wickham has seen him, and he professes
entire ignorance of the connection; but I
think he must decline being counsel for Emmet in
a case in which his daughter may be implicated. It
is a very extraordinary story, and strengthens the
case against Emmet.” A rumour of the fate of his
letters was allowed to reach Emmet, and cut him to
the quick. He wrote at once begging that the third
letter (surely with news of his arrest, and with such
assurances and sorrowful endearments as the occasion
called for), might not be withheld; and in
exchange for the service demanded, knowing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the Government already feared what that eloquent
tongue might have to say in court, he offered to plead
guilty, and go dumb to the grave. He who had
staked so much on the purity of his public motive,
he who cared only, and cared fiercely, for the clearing
of his name from the misconceptions of posterity,
he who was one of the elect souls loving his love so
much because he loved honour more—he, Robert
Emmet, was willing to forfeit every chance of his
own vindication for the sake of the sad girl brought
into abhorrent publicity by his rashness. He said
he had injured her; he pleaded for the delivery of
the letter, and offered his own coveted silence as the
price of it. “That was certainly a fine trait in his
character,” said Grattan, who looked upon him as a
visionary broken justly upon the wheel of things
ordained. Sarah never received her letter. But
the discovery that there had been a correspondence
between herself and the arch-rebel was a highly
important-looking circumstance, and with all apologies
to its distinguished owner, the Priory at Rathfarnham
was ordered to be searched. Mr. Curran
was not at home, but he returned in season to meet
Major Sirr and the armed escort riding down his
drive-way, and aglow with virtuous wrath at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
possibility of suspicion alighting upon him or his,
he went to clear himself before the Privy Council.
Though his action secured its ends, being voluntary
and merely formal, it was a singular humiliation to
the paternity concerned. But the culminating shock
he had to endure arose from another cause. Sarah’s
apartments had been searched; Emmet’s glowing
letters, openly alluding to his purposes, had been
seized, and tied up and carried away. Here was
complicity indeed! and the knowledge of it came
upon him like a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Within a few days, towards the end of this month
of August, Mr. Curran himself received a letter
from Robert Emmet. It was neither signed nor
dated, and opened abruptly, waiving all formalities,
not from any hidden defiance, but from entire
absorption in the mournful retrospect it called up.
As we know from Lord Hardwicke’s communication,
Emmet had retained Mr. Curran for his counsel, and
it was thought fitting that the latter should decline
the brief for the defence. Of course Mr. Curran
threw it up; no man could have done otherwise.
But his general turmoil, and the apparent motives of
it, are not a particularly noble spectacle. The young
prisoner, meanwhile, had something to say to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did not expect you to be my counsel. I
nominated you, because not to have done so might
have appeared remarkable. Had Mr. ——<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> been
in town, I did not even wish to have seen you, but
as he was not, I wrote to you to come to me at once.
I know that I have done you very severe injury,
much greater than I can atone for with my life;
that atonement I did offer to make before the
Privy Council by pleading guilty if those documents
were suppressed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My intention was not to leave
the suppression of those documents to possibility,
but to render it unnecessary for anyone to plead for
me, by pleading guilty to the charge myself. The
circumstances that I am now going to mention I do
not state in my own justification. When I first
addressed your daughter I expected that in another
week my own fate would have been decided. I
knew that in case of success many others would
look on me differently from what they did at that
moment; but I speak with sincerity when I say that
I never was anxious for situation or distinction myself,
and I did not wish to be united to one who
was. I spoke to your daughter, neither expecting
nor (under those circumstances) wishing that there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>should be a return of attachment, but wishing to
judge of her dispositions, to know how far they
might be not unfavourable or disengaged, and to
know what foundation I might afterwards have to
count on. I received no encouragement whatever.
She told me she had no attachment for any person,
nor did she seem likely to have any that could make
her wish to quit you. I stayed away till the time
had elapsed, when I found that the event to which
I allude was to be postponed indefinitely. I returned,
by a kind of infatuation, thinking that to myself
only was I giving pleasure or pain. I perceived no
progress of attachment on her part, nor anything in
her conduct to distinguish me from a common
acquaintance. Afterwards I had reason to suppose
that [political] discoveries were made, and that I
should be obliged to quit the kingdom immediately.
I came to make a renunciation of any approach to
friendship that might have been formed. On that
very day she herself spoke to me to discontinue my
visits; I told her it was my intention, and I
mentioned the reason. I then for the first time
found, when I was unfortunate, by the manner in
which she was affected, that there was a return of
affection, and that it was too late to retreat. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
own apprehensions also I afterwards found were
without cause; and I remained. There has been
much culpability on my part in all this, but there
has also been a great deal of that misfortune which
seems uniformly to have accompanied me. That I
have written to your daughter since an unfortunate
event [the arrest], has taken place, was an additional
breach of propriety for which I have suffered well;
but I will candidly confess that I not only do not
feel it to have been of the same extent, but that I
consider it to have been unavoidable after what had
passed. For though I shall not attempt to justify
in the smallest degree my former conduct, yet,
when an attachment was once formed between us
(and a sincerer one never did exist), I feel that,
peculiarly circumstanced as I then was, to have left
her uncertain of my situation would neither have
weaned her affections nor lessened her anxiety; and
looking upon her as one whom, if I lived, I hoped to
have had my partner for life, I did hold the removing
of her anxiety above every other consideration. I
would rather have the affections of your daughter in
the back settlements of America, than the first situation
this country could offer without them. I know
not whether this will be any extenuation of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
offence; I know not whether it will be any extenuation
of it to know that if I had that situation in my
power at this moment I would relinquish it to
devote my life to her happiness; I know not whether
success would have blotted out the recollection of
what I have done; but I [do] know that a man with
the coldness of death on him need not to be made to
feel any other coldness, and that he may be spared
any addition to the misery he feels, not for himself,
but for those to whom he has left nothing but
sorrow.”</p>

<p>It is apparent from this page that the great Mr.
Curran had not withheld from one under misfortune
some crumbs of that verbal opulence for which he
was famous. Emmet’s disclaimer of any eagerness
on Sarah’s part in reciprocating his devotion is a
knightly one. The interpretation of her maidenly
conduct, purely chivalric, was designed to exculpate
her in her over-lord’s eyes.</p>

<p>Poor Sarah, thus rudely informed by events of her
Robert’s arrest, in an hour of unprecedented torment,
did not lack the tender consideration from the Chief
Secretary and the Attorney-General, which her innocent
misery deserved. Lord Hardwicke, too, directed
that no action of any kind should be taken against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
her. But the stress of this last summer day was too
much for her after the intense emotional life she had
been bearing so long alone. In the breath of her love’s
exposure and of her father’s anger head and heart
seemed to break together, and for months to come
she was to be wholly and most mercifully exempt
from the “rack of this rough world.” On September
16, the Home Secretary was able to felicitate the
Lord Lieutenant from Whitehall on his generous
treatment of the implicated rebel at the Priory:
“Your delicacy and management,” he says, “with
regard to the Curran family is highly applauded.
The King is particularly pleased with it. It is a sad
affair. Mademoiselle seems a true pupil of Mary
Wollstonecraft.” This, of course, amounts to the
accusation that gentle little Sarah, with her sweet
eyes and her “most harmonious voice,” was guilty of
doing her own thinking, and of doing it, which was
worst of all, upon political matters. It supplies us,
at any rate, with evidence of the wide and deep
grounds for Emmet’s true passion for the girl whose
national ideals could so fearlessly keep pace with
his own. Heart and brain, soul and body, she
would have been his perfect mate. Her father’s
harshness was the one element needed to perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Sarah’s desolation. Her real life closed without
conscious pain, and remained for a decent space
buried. She never had to look in the face the
day of Emmet’s death, the all-significant day
“under her solemn fillet;” for that had tiptoed past
her while her reason slept. The good sister Amelia,
afterwards Shelley’s friend and portrait-painter in
Italy, as soon as Sarah could be moved, took her
away from the intolerable home, and left her with
loving Quaker friends, the Penroses of Cork.
During all the time of her affliction and illness at
the Priory, Mr. Curran is said never to have looked
upon his youngest daughter’s face; and from the
hour of her leaving Dublin, presumably under an
allowance made for her support, he seems neither
ever to have sent her a message, nor to have thought
of her again.</p>

<p>There are several historic instances of a like
fatherliness in fathers, a century ago. Mr. Curran
doubtless felt outraged in every fibre, and not more
indignant at the independent conduct of his meek
domestic vassal than at the astounding ignorance in
which she had contrived to keep him. Yet there
were powerful pleas for compassion in such a case
inherent in his own history. In early manhood he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
himself had figured as collaborator in a similar headlong
falling in love, a similar breach of parental
discipline. John Philpot Curran had been for a
short time tutor in the family of a fellow-Whig, Dr.
Richard Creagh of Creagh Castle, near Spenser’s
Doneraile, when with Miss Creagh, a young lady of
beauty and of moderate fortune, he contracted a
private marriage. The discovery brought on storms;
but on further reflection Dr. Creagh saw fit to
forgive the offenders, to receive them once more
beneath his roof, and even to allow his daughter’s
portion to be expended without stint on Mr. Curran,
until he had completed his legal studies in London,
and begun to establish his inevitable ascendancy at
the Bar. The match, however, seems never to have
been a happy one. Conjugal differences seldom
lack their annotation. Without adopting the adjective
missiles of either faction, let it suffice to say
that they parted, in the summary fashion of which
we are already aware. Mr. Curran had earned
a right, he may have thought, to his opinion of
women. The memory of his calamity may well
have operated to make him both excessively exacting
as to female behaviour and pitiless towards any
supposed violation of it. In one touching story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of domestic ruin, at least, he had a deplorable
influence. Mr. W. J. Fitzpatrick, in his <i>Life,
Times, and Contemporaries of Lord Cloncurry</i>, records
that after the Lady Cloncurry’s trespass, her
generous husband would have taken her back,
“were it not for his well-beloved J——n P——t
C——n, who urged him, in strong and persuasive
language, to the contrary.” Moreover, an Irish
father is as likely as not to cherish spacious ideas
of his own governing prerogative, and refuse to
be tied in the matter to “anything so temporal,”
as Lowell says in another application, “as a responsibility.”
Mr. Curran could have bespoken for
his children other destinies if they had ever known
freedom of the heart at home.</p>

<p>Again, his attitude towards Emmet may have
seemed to him no exaggerated hatred, but the mere
tribute of virtuous scorn. In that, however, he
was self-deceived. To any publicist in Ireland with
the seed of compromise in him, even if the compromise
never amounted to the smallest sacrifice
of actual principle, Robert Emmet’s straight career
must have been like a buffet in the face. Naked logic
was Emmet’s element, and the expedient his negligible
quantity. Every agitation sincerely founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
on a popular need breeds, in time, its extremists.
They are the glory and the difficulty of all reform.
It might have been said of Emmet, as at the outset
of the Oxford Movement it was said of Hurrell
Froude, that “the gentleman was not afraid of
inferences.” Curran’s thoughts dwelt in no such
simplified worlds. Like all the best Irishmen of
his blazingly brilliant day, he was for Parliamentary
Reform and Catholic Emancipation, and against the
Union. It was even he who appeared to defend the
revolutionists of 1798, who had obtained the writ
of <i>habeas corpus</i> for Wolfe Tone on the very morning
set for his execution under court-martial (a
reprieve frustrated by suicide), and who was the first
to plead, though with vain eloquence, at the bar of
attainder for the Fitzgerald heirs. But though his
convictions seemed close enough to Emmet’s, there
was wide variance in their bearing and momentum.
Initial or generic differences take on an almost
amatory complexion when contrasted with those
springing from the final consideration in like minds.
Both men vehemently desired the framing of fresh
good laws, and the unhampered operation of existing
good laws, for Ireland. To Curran, incorruptible
as he was, England was an excellent general superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and referee to set over the concerns of
other nations, including his own, provided that she
could be got to abstain scrupulously from undue
interference, and hold tenure under a more than
nominal corporal withdrawal. Poor Emmet’s ideal
of Irish independence was remote enough from this.
He had read somewhere that his country used to
be a proud kingdom, and not a petted province.
Surely, Curran in his latter years, when he “sank”
(the word is Cloncurry’s, and used of his friend) to
office, could have no patience with a Separatist son-in-law.
But the Master of the Rolls continued to
be a great man, and Emmet at twenty-five ceased
to be a fool.</p>

<p>The trial came off before Lord Norbury, Mr.
Baron George, and Mr. Baron Daly on September
19, 1803, at the court-house in Green Street. It
is an extraordinary circumstance that it lasted eleven
hours in a crowded room, the prisoner standing for
all that time in the dock without proper food or
rest. Mr. Emmet firmly refused to call any witnesses,
to allow any statement by his counsel, or to
furnish any comment upon the evidence. Long
afterwards, Mr. Peter Burrowes told Moore of the
continual check put upon his own attempts to disconcert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
those who were giving testimony. “No,
no,” Emmet would protest, “the man is speaking
the truth.” The indictment was in part
strengthened by the reading in court of passages
of his own captured love-letters to Miss Curran.
Thanks to the consideration of the Attorney-General
the reading was brief and as non-committal
as possible, Miss Curran’s name being of course
suppressed. The Attorney-General (Mr. Standish
O’Grady) showed, throughout the poor girl’s
troubles, a most fatherly solicitude towards her,
and pleaded for her with her own father, without
appreciable results.</p>

<p>Emmet had other annoyances to bear. Mr.
Conyngham Plunkett, as counsel for the Crown,
took an unfair advantage of the silence of the
counsels for the prisoner (Messrs. Ball, Burrowes,
and M’Nally), and delivered at great length a very
able oration, in which, <i>more Hibernico</i>, he had rather
more to say of the Creator of men, and of His
implicit support of the existing Government, than
was strictly necessary; neither did he forget to
recommend “sincere repentance of crime” to “the
unfortunate young gentleman.” And when Emmet
himself was invited to speak, and did so, or would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
have done so, to really magnificent purpose, he was
causelessly and continually interrupted by the presiding
judge, lectured on the virtues and the standing
of his long-deceased elder brother, and on the
abominable anomaly of “a gentleman by birth”
associating with “the most profligate and abandoned
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hostlers, bakers, butchers, and such persons!”
A sprig of lavender was handed him by some woman
in the close court-room; it was snatched away as
soon, on the groundless suspicion that it had been
poisoned by one who would save the youth from his
approaching fate. The jury, without leaving the
box, brought in a verdict of guilty. It was to them
a clear case. As the Earl of Hardwicke wrote to
his brother, the Honourable Charles Yorke, “it was
unanimously admitted that a more complete case of
treason was never stated in a court of justice.” Of
Emmet himself he adds conclusively: “He persisted
in the opinions he had entertained, and the
principles in which he had been educated.”</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when the Clerk of the
Crown, following the usual form, ended: “Prisoner
at the bar, what have you therefore now to say why
judgment of death and execution should not be
awarded against you according to law?” Emmet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
was weary, but had body and mind under triumphant
control, and he filled the next half-hour with
words which were overwhelming at the time, and
will never fail to thrill the most casual reader who
can discern in them the victory of the human spirit
over the powers which crush it. It is an immortal
appeal. The rich phrases, the graceful, quick
gestures, were unprepared and born of the moment.
We are told that Emmet walked about a little, or
stood bending hither and thither, in his earnestness.
“He seemed to have acquired a swaying motion,
when he spoke in public, which was peculiar to
him; but there was no affectation in it.” It was a
habit which the young man shared with a great contemporary
singularly free from mannerisms: the
Grattan to whom he used to listen, spell-bound, in
his early years. Emmet has been misreported in
one important particular. He had a fine understanding
of the uses of irony; but it is his praise
that he was also scrupulously, persistently, and invincibly
courteous. To know him is to know that
sentences such as those figuring in some reports of
his speech, about “that viper,” meaning (Mr.
Plunkett), or “persons who would not disgrace
themselves by shaking your (that is, Lord Norbury’s)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
blood-stained hand,” are, as attributed to him,
all but impossible. The truth seems to be that
his admirers, finding him unaccountably lacking
in invective, and the vituperative power of the
Gael, have amended, between them, this evidence of
his undutiful shortcomings. It were a pity to summarise
or paraphrase that living rhetoric, so fit in
its place. We are disposed to forget nowadays
that emotional speech is natural speech: its many
and seemingly exuberant colours are but primal
and legitimate, whereas it is our subdued daily
chatter which is artificial. Emmet did not occupy
himself with refuting the charge of having revolted
against existing political conditions with “the scum
of the Liberties behind him,” for he had a concern
more intimate. It had been reported broadcast, and
it had been taken for granted at the trial, that he
had become an agent of France because he sought
to deliver the country over to French rule. Hopeless,
there and then, of being understood on the
main issue, he was determined to make himself
plain in this. He admitted that he had indeed
laboured to establish a French alliance, but expressly
under bond that aided Ireland, once freed, should
be as completely independent of France as he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
have her of England. He sought, as he said, such
a guarantee as Franklin had secured for America.
For the reassertion of his own position as a patriot,
Emmet spent his last energies. Like some few
other selfless reformers known to history, he had
taken little pains to proclaim himself, and in consequence
had been translated into terms of expected
profit and personal ambition, in the generalising
minds of bystanders. It was nothing to him to go
to his untimely grave legally convicted of Utopianism,
precipitation, madness, or even of monstrous
wickedness; but why he had plunged into such
folly, or such crime, or such pure passion for
freedom, as the case might be, seemed to demand
some explanation from the person best qualified to
give it. To risk that his informing intent should be
misread hereafter, was more than he could bear.
And thus it came about that, reserved as he always
was, humble as he always was, he blazed out at last,
and feared not to base himself proudly on “my
character.” The word recurs: its numerical strength
is almost equal to that of the beloved other one,
“my country.” This was clearly a tautologous
egotist, this young belated Girondin, to those who
knew him not. As he talked on, in his beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
round tones, into the night, the dingy lamps begun
to sputter as if tired of their unexpected vigil.
“My lamp of life is nearly extinguished,” he said,
looking sadly down. And then: “My race is run.
The grave opens to receive me, and I sink into
its bosom. I have but one request to make, at my
departure from this world: it is the charity of its
silence. Let no man write my epitaph; for as no
man who knows my motives dare now vindicate
them, let not prejudice nor ignorance asperse them.
Let them rest in obscurity and peace; let my
memory remain in oblivion, and my tomb remain
uninscribed, until other times and other men can
do justice to my character. When my country
shall have taken her place among the nations of the
earth, then, and not till then, let my epitaph be
written. I have done.” There was perceptible
emotion in every breast but his, when sentence of
death by hanging and beheading was given at half-past
ten o’clock, and ordered to take place next day.</p>

<p>Emmet’s strong slight frame had stood the long
ordeal perfectly, and his mood had wings. He
whispered cheerfully through the grating: “I
shall be hanged to-morrow!” as he passed John
Hickson’s cell on his way back to his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>We know he read the Litany there; and he
also indulged a turn for secular, and even profane
employment. In fact, it pleased Mr. Robert
Emmet to draw himself (he drew exquisitely) as
a posthumous serial in two parts. Some one found
and recognised the grim <i>R. E., head</i>, the disconcerted
<i>R. E., body</i>, on separate scraps of paper:
they lay on his little table, when all was over,
witnesses to the detached humour possible to an
easy conscience. His industry was great during the
few remaining hours. He possessed a lock of his
absent Sarah’s hair, which she may have given him
years before: this he wished to wear in his dying
hour. As he sat plaiting it minutely, and tenderly
fastening it into the fold of his velvet stock, he was
noticed and questioned. Fearing that the treasure
might be taken from him, he said that his occupation
was “an innocent one.” The only persons
allowed to see him were the chaplains and M’Nally,
the fine flower of infamy, happy in Government
pay, who to the end played with success the part
of the assiduous friend. It was he who brought
to Emmet on his final morning the news, then ten
days old, of his mother’s death. The son took it,
as he took all his losses, with what Mr. W. H.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Curran briefly calls his “unostentatious fortitude.”
After an instant of silence he looked up and found
his voice. “It is better so,” he answered quietly.
Her delicate proud heart had broken at the menace
hanging over her darling: that much he had divined
at once. She had written, during that last year, that
she was “a parent supremely blest” in the virtues
and dispositions of her children.</p>

<p>Mr. M’Nally was intimate with Mr. Curran, for
whom he had an affection as genuine as he was
capable of feeling. It was like “Janus” Wainewright’s
affection for Charles Lamb, and as exempt
from the poison-cup otherwise dealt impartially to
divers and sundry. It is possible, therefore, that
Mr. M’Nally chose to acquaint his much-deceived
client with the true state of Sarah’s health: a life-in-death
which also was surely “better so.” But this
is mere conjecture, as Emmet would never have
inquired; rather than name his “nut-brown maid,”
the truly “banished man” would still have endured
all the inner turmoil of lonely love,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Which wash both Heaven and Hell.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No credit need be given to the tale that as Emmet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
went forth to his death through the Dublin streets, a
young lady, believed to be Miss Curran, was seen in
a carriage despairingly taking leave of him, and fluttering
a handkerchief until he was out of sight, when she
sank in a swoon. It is not the fashion of persons of
deep feeling, save on the stage, to have recourse at
solemn moments to fluttering handkerchiefs. If any
young lady interested in Robert Emmet were abroad
in a carriage on that autumn morning, it would be
his only sister, Mrs. Holmes, fated to outlive him
but one melancholy year. As for poor lovely Sarah,
she had disappeared like an underground stream
during his last weeks and days, ever since her letters
were seized as spoils of war. Major Sirr is believed
to have destroyed them all, in due course, not without
a flow of tears! The sweet lady was indeed an
object of pity; and Emmet, putting in never a stroke
of conscious work, had a most unaccountable faculty
for melting hearts. The reign of Sensibility was not
over; able-bodied persons in 1803 were only beginning
to be carried out of the pit, more dead than
alive, when Mrs. Siddons played. But something in
Emmet’s uncomplaining presence overcame stern
men habituated to political offenders. The honest
turnkey at Kilmainham fell fainting at his feet, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to hear the affectionately-proffered good-bye; and
it was generally noticed that Lord Norbury, facing
him, could with difficulty steady his voice, though
he was popularly believed to revel in pronouncing
capital sentence.</p>

<p>Emmet busied himself with letters in his cell. He
slept and ate as usual; and his firm handwriting
witnessed the unshaken soul within. Several of his
last letters have been recovered; two or three have
been published, in Mr. W. H. Curran’s <i>Life</i> of his
illustrious father, in Dr. Madden’s moving but
chaotic <i>Memoirs of the United Irishmen</i>, and elsewhere.
On the day set for his execution Robert
Emmet wrote to his old friend Richard Curran:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Richard</span>: I find I have but a few
hours to live; but if it was the last moment, and the
power of utterance was leaving me, I would thank
you from the bottom of my heart for your generous
expressions of affection and forgiveness to me. If
there was any one in the world in whose breast my
death might be supposed not to stifle every spark of
resentment, it might be you. I have deeply injured
you; I have injured the happiness of a sister that you
love, and who was formed to give happiness to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
one about her, instead of having her own mind a
prey to affliction. Oh, Richard! I have no excuse
to offer, but that I meant the reverse: I intended
as much happiness for Sarah as the most ardent love
could have given her. I never did tell you how
much I idolised her. It was not with a wild or unfounded
passion, but it was an attachment increasing
every hour, from an admiration of the purity of her
mind, and respect for her talents. I did dwell in
secret upon the prospect of our union; I did hope
that success, while it afforded the opportunity of
our union, might be a means of confirming an attachment
which misfortune had called forth. I did
not look to honours for myself; praise I would have
asked from the lips of no man: but I would have
wished to read, in the glow of Sarah’s countenance,
that her husband was respected. My love, Sarah!
it was not thus that I thought to have requited your
affection. I did hope to be a prop round which
your affections might have clung, and which would
never have been shaken; but a rude blast has
snapped it, and they have fallen over a grave. This
is no time for affliction. I have had public motives
to sustain my mind, and I have not suffered it to
sink; but there have been moments in my imprisonment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
when my mind was so sunk by grief on her
account that death would have been a refuge. God
bless you, my dearest Richard. I am obliged to

<p>This touching letter has been printed before, but
the two which follow, long lost and newly found,
have never been made public. The original letters
seem to have disappeared. The contemporary
copies figure in the Hardwicke or Wimpole
collection, which has very recently been made
accessible to readers by the issue of the current
Catalogue of Additional Manuscripts at the British
Museum. The shorter of them was intended by
Emmet for Thomas Addis Emmet and his wife
Jane Patten, his brother and sister-in-law. With
it was sent a long historical document, called <i>An
Account of the late Plan of Insurrection in Dublin,
and the Causes of its Failure</i>. Hurriedly penned,
in order to give the beloved relatives a unique and
direct knowledge of all that the writer had meant
and missed, it is a masterly detailed statement, as
free from all traces of morbidity, or even of agitation,
as if it had been drawn up “on happy mornings
with a morning heart,” in the tents of victory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Thanks to the practised duplicity of Dr. Trevor,
to whose care it was confided, Mr. Thomas Addis
Emmet, then in Paris, never received it; he complained
bitterly of its suppression, and was only
towards the close of his life enabled to read it
through the medium of the press. But neither he
nor any of his American descendants, inclusive of
the distinguished compiler of the quarto, privately
printed in New York, entitled <i>The Emmet Family</i>,
seems to have suspected the existence of the little
personal note in which the <i>Account</i> was enclosed.
The official draft of it figures in Hard. MS.
35,742, f. 197:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Tom and Jane</span>: I am just
going to do my last duty to my country. It can
be done as well on the scaffold as in the field. Do
not give way to any weak feelings on my account,
but rather encourage proud ones that I have possessed
fortitude and tranquillity of mind to the last.</p>

<p>“God bless you, and the young hopes that are
growing up about you. May they be more fortunate
than their uncle, but may they preserve as
pure and ardent an attachment to their country as
he has done. Give the watch to little Robert; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
will not prize it the less for having been in the
possession of two Roberts before him. I have one
dying request to make to you. I was attached to
Sarah Curran, the youngest daughter of your
friend. I did hope to have had her my companion
for life; I did hope that she would not only have
constituted my happiness, but that her heart and
understanding would have made her one of Jane’s
dearest friends. I know that Jane would have loved
her on my account, and I feel also that, had they
been acquainted, she must have loved her for her
own. None knew of the attachment till now, nor
is it now generally known; therefore do not speak
of it to others. [I leave her]<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with her father and
brother; but if those protectors should fall off, and
that no other should replace them, [take]<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> her as
my wife, and love her as a sister. Give my love
to all friends.”</p></div>

<p>It is to be feared that “little Robert” (the eldest
of the children, afterwards Judge Robert Emmet of
New York) did not receive his legacy. According
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>to what testimony can be gathered, the watch which
Emmet carried to the last was either presented to
the executioner, or passed over to him with some
understanding which has not transpired. Poor
Emmet’s seal, a beautiful design of his own for the
United Irishmen, went safely into friendly keeping;
but most of his personal belongings worn on the
scaffold, including his high Hessian boots and the
stock with the precious hair sewed inside the lining,
were actually sold at auction in Grafton Street,
Dublin, during December, 1832. In this letter to
his brother and sister, how piercing is the “I did
hope,” iterated to them as to Richard Curran! It
reminds us what a network of beneficent will and
forethought made up that intense nature, and how
the perishing leaf was but in the green. When the
Lord Lieutenant, in the course of his industrious
correspondence with his brother, sent to him, as a
literary curio, a copy of Robert Emmet’s letter
(Robert himself being newly dead), in reference
to it, he hastens to add this significant sentence:
“The letter to his brother will not be forwarded;
but the passage respecting Miss Sarah Curran has
been communicated to her father.” The Chief
Secretary and Lord Hardwicke were joint contrivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of what seems to us (from the point of
view of the most helpless of the persons chiefly
concerned) an unnecessary if not unfeeling move.
And Mr. Curran promptly replied to the former,
the Right Honourable William Wickham, on the
morrow (Hard. MS. 35,703, f. 158):—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="right">
“<i>Sept. 21st, 1803.</i><br />
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have just received the honour of your
letter, with the extract enclosed by desire of His
Excellency. I have again to offer to His Excellency
my more than gratitude, the feelings of the
strongest attachment and respect for this new instance
of considerate condescension. To you also,
sir, believe me, I am most affectionately grateful
for the part that you have been so kind as [to] take
upon this unhappy occasion; few would, I am well
aware, perhaps few could, have known how to act
in the same manner.</p>

<p>“As to the communication of the extract, and
the motive for doing so, I cannot answer them in
the cold parade of official acknowledgment; I feel
on the subject the warm and animated thanks of
man to man, and these I presume to request that
Lord Hardwicke and Mr. Wickham may be pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to accept: it is, however, only justice to myself to
say, that even on the first falling of this unexpected
blow, I had resolved (and so mentioned to Mr.
Attorney-General), that if I found no actual guilt
upon her, I would act with as much moderation as
possible towards a poor creature that had once held
the warmest place in my heart. I did, even then,
recollect that there was a point to which nothing
but actual turpitude or the actual death of her
parent ought to make a child an orphan; but even
had I thought otherwise, I feel that this extract
would have produced the effect it was intended to
have, and that I should think so now. I feel how
I should shrink from the idea of letting her sink so
low as to become the subject of the testamentary
order of a miscreant who could labour, by so foul
means and under such odious circumstances, to
connect her with his infamy, and to acquire any
posthumous interest in her person or her fate.
Blotted, therefore, as she may irretrievably be from
my society, or the place she once held in my affection,
she must not go adrift. So far, at least,
‘these protectors will not fall off.’</p>

<p>“I should therefore, sir, wish for the suppression
of this extract, if no particular, motive should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
arisen for forwarding it to its destination. I shall
avail myself of your kind permission to wait upon
you in the course of the day, to pay my respects
once more personally to you, if I shall be so
fortunate as to find you at leisure. I have the
honour to be, with very great respect, your
obliged servant,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">John P. Curran</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>But it is time to return to our death-doomed
“miscreant.” At half-past one, on the afternoon of
September 30, the order was given to start. The
scaffold had been built in Thomas Street, nearly
opposite S. Catherine’s Church. He was dressed all
in black, and maintained the serene and undemonstrative
demeanour which was thought scandalously
unbefitting by some spectators and some scribes. On
the principle that the game was up, that “no hope
can have no fear,” Robert Emmet became, not indifferent,
but beautifully gay towards the end, as gay
in irons as Raleigh or Sir Thomas More. He was
quite sure that he had nothing to repent of, now
that the account was cast and cancelled. Of course
his care-free conduct was misconstrued: it passed
officially for “effrontery and nonchalance,” and the
single-minded Christian, never quite out of touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
with the Church in which his holy mother had
brought him up, was darkly given forth as an impenitent
atheist. The ordinary attitude of the revolutionary
late eighteenth-century mind was irreligious
enough, but it was not Robert Emmet’s. One of
his colleagues in the dream and the disaster, Thomas
Russell, an elder figure in Emmet’s never-marshalled
“army,” and a nobly interesting one, was extraordinarily
pious: as pious as General Gordon. On
the scaffold at Downpatrick (brought to that by his
thwarted outbreak in the North), he recalled, for a
memory well suited to encourage him, “my young
hero, my great and dear friend, a martyr to the
cause of his country and to liberty.” Russell’s hospitality
of mind was not such that he could have
made an exemplar of an infidel. But there is so
much proof on this point, that the old charge may
be laid aside in that limbo of all inaccuracies for
which the invention of printing is responsible. The
Englishman at the helm of affairs in Dublin, by no
means (as we have seen) a wholly unsympathetic
annalist, bequeaths us an account of Emmet’s final
interview with the chaplains. It cannot escape
the reader that two distinct issues were, in the
minds of those worthy gentlemen, vaguely blended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
No person in Mr. Robert Emmet’s situation, unless
he repented of his politics, had any chance of being
considered otherwise than unsound in his religion.
Individualism, looked upon as the exact science it
undoubtedly is, was not quite at its best in the self-righteous
era of George the Third, and under the
Establishment which was regulated by a now almost
obsolete basilolatry.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gamble, the clergyman who attends the
prisoners in Newgate, visited [Mr. Emmet] yesterday
evening, and again this morning, in Kilmainham
Prison, in company with the Reverend Mr. Grant,
a clergyman who resides at Island Bridge. In the
report which they have made to me of what passed
in their communications with Mr. Emmet, they
state that though their conversation did not produce
all the good they had hoped, it had nevertheless
the effect of bringing him to a more calm, and
in some respects a better temper of mind, than they
had reason to expect from a person professing the
principles by which they supposed him to be directed.
They repeatedly urged to him those topics which
were likely to bring him to a better feeling, and
acknowledgment of the crime for which he was to
suffer, but were not successful in persuading him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
abjure those principles by which he was actuated in
his conspiracy to overthrow the Government. He
disclaimed any intention of shedding blood; professed
a total ignorance of the murder of Lord
Kilwarden, before which, he declares, he had left
Dublin; and also professed an aversion to the French.
He declared that though persons professing his principles,
and acting in the cause in which he had been
concerned, were generally supposed to be Deists, that
he was a Christian in the true sense of the word;
that he had received the Sacrament, though not
regularly and habitually, and that he wished to
receive it then; that what he felt, he felt sincerely,
and would avow his principles in his last moments;
that he was conscious of sins, and wished to receive
the Sacrament. The clergymen consented to join
in prayer with him, and administered the Sacrament
to him, considering him as a visionary enthusiast,
and wishing him to bring his mind to a proper
temper and sense of religion.</p>

<p>“On their way to the place of execution they
conversed with him upon the same topics, but
could never persuade him to admit that he had
been in the wrong. In answer to their question
whether, if he had foreseen the blood that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
spilt in consequence of his attempt, he would have
persisted in his design to overthrow the Government,
he observed that no one went to battle
without being prepared for similar events, always
considering his attempt as free from moral reproach
in consequence of what he conceived to be the
goodness of the motive that produced it. At the
place of execution he was desirous of addressing the
people. He intended to have declared that he had
never taken any oath but that of the United Irishmen,
and by that oath he meant to abide. The
clergymen who were present explained to him that
an address to that effect might possibly produce
tumult and bloodshed, and that it ought not to be
permitted. He was therefore obliged to acquiesce,
and did so without appearing to be disturbed or
agitated.” (Hard. MS. 35,742, ff. 191 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>What Robert Emmet did say to the people,
a sentence seemingly of puzzling platitude, was, in
him, one of profound truth: “My friends, I die
in peace, and with sentiments of love and kindness
to all men.” There is another and more animated
contemporary account of his exit in <i>The Life and
Times of Henry Grattan</i>. The whole passage may
as well be quoted:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Robert Emmet [was] devoid of caution, foresight,
and prudence: ardent, spirited, and impetuous.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He was an enthusiast, he was a visionary. Without
a treasury, without officers, without troops, he
declared war against England and France, and prepared
to oppose both!—the one, if she sought to
retain possession of Ireland, and the other, if she
attempted to invade it. With a few followers, he
rose to take the Castle of Dublin and defeat a
disciplined garrison. He put on a green coat and a
cocked hat, and fancied himself already a conqueror.
If no lives had been lost he probably would not have
suffered, although Lord Norbury was the judge who
tried him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When asked the usual question
why sentence should not be passed on him, he
exclaimed: ‘Sentence of death may be pronounced:
I have nothing to say. But sentence of infamy shall
not be pronounced: I have everything to say.’ He
was as cool and collected before his death as if
nothing was to happen. Peter Burrowes saw him
on his way, and related a circumstance that occurred
as he was going to execution. He had a paper that
he wished to be brought to Miss Curran, to whom
he was strongly attached: he watched his opportunity,
and in passing one of the streets, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
caught a friendly eye in the crowd, and making a
sign to the person, got him near; then he dropped a
paper. This was observed by others, and the person
who took it up was stopped: the paper was taken
from him and brought to the Castle. Mr. Burrowes
and Charles Bushe saw it, and said it was a very
affecting and interesting letter.”</p>

<p>And so to poor Emmet, Fate, in her most
diabolical mood, had for the last time played the
postman. He shook hands with the masked executioner,
removed his own stock, and helped to
adjust both the cap and the noose. The correspondent
of the <i>London Daily Chronicle</i>, after a
fervent “God forbid that I should see many persons
with Emmet’s principles!” adds in unwilling tribute—and
those were the days when a hanging was a
favourite spectacle with persons of elegant leisure—“As
it was, I never saw one die like him.” When
all was over, and the head, with every feature composed
and pale as in life, had been held up with the
formula proper to traitors, that and the body were
brought back to the gaol, and shortly after buried in
the common ground, Bully’s Acre, none of Emmet’s
few living kindred appearing then to claim it. His
parents were not long dead; his only brother was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in exile; his sister was a delicate woman, probably
crushed by her latest grief, and her husband, Mr.
Robert Holmes, a most serviceable friend, was in
prison; John Patten, Thomas Addis Emmet’s
brother-in-law, was far away; St. John Mason, a
cousin of the Emmets, and one heart and soul with
them in all that pertained to the wished-for welfare
of Ireland, was, like Mr. Holmes, and for the same
reason, the tenant of a cell. Others, more remotely
connected by affection with Robert Emmet, might
have come forward in time had any one realised the
blight, the paralysis, which events had imposed
simultaneously on the entire family. It seems
pretty conclusive from a valuable pamphlet just
published by Mr. David A. Quaid (though the
facts are not yet verified), that Robert Emmet
was laid to rest in his father’s vault in the churchyard
of St. Peter, Aungier Street. There one may
leave that sentinel dust until the day of conciser
habit than his own shall carve the good word above
it which he foreknew.</p>

<p>Sarah Curran’s quiet annals are ungathered by any
one hand, but the main outlines are henceforth discernible,
and some celebrated writers have found
them of interest. Washington Irving, in <i>The Broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Heart</i>, has given her an exquisite immortality; and
the pathetic central incident of his narration is also
the inspiration of Moore’s haunting song: <i>She is
far from the land</i>. It was not, however, at the
Rotunda in Dublin, but in a festal room in the
friendly house where, after the death of her
betrothed, she lived on in a dispirited convalescence,
that she wandered away from the company, and
sitting alone on the stair, began singing softly a
plaintive air, “housed in a dream, at distance from
the kind.” This happened at Woodhill, in Cork. Her
voice seems to have been singularly beautiful: there
was a general development of musical genius in her
father’s family. The incident was reported at firsthand
to Irving, as to Moore. To those who knew
her story, the little forgetful act was poignant
enough: for she was singing to the dead. In her
sorrow, her deprivations, her entire withdrawal from
the world, Miss Curran was blest with tender friends
and champions. The poet just named, who was
one of Robert Emmet’s early comrades, knew how
admiration followed her like her shadow.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And lovers are round her, sighing:</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But coldly she turns from their gaze, and weeps,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For her heart in his grave is lying.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Among those who looked with infinite sympathy
and respect on the gentle girl moving like a soulless
phantom in an unreal world, was a very young
Englishman, barely her senior, a newly commissioned
captain of Royal Engineers, a lineal descendant of
Strafford, and full of Strafford’s strong singleness of
heart. Henry Robert Sturgeon was third son of
William Sturgeon, Esquire, and the Lady Henrietta
Alicia Watson-Wentworth; grandson of the first,
and nephew of the second Marquis of Rockingham.
He conceived for Sarah Curran an instinctive
affection, ardent and profound, and free from stain of
self as Emmet’s own. It was as if Emmet, absented
for ever, had breathed himself into another for the
comfort and protection of the well-beloved. But
the well-beloved would not be comforted nor protected:
not though she knew, as she knew perfectly,
both what her suitor’s worth was, and what were his
fortune and standing in the great world; not
though every member of the Penrose family,
devoted to him, encouraged his hope; not though
all of them, of their own accord, interceded with
their ward and guest. In the <i>Literary Souvenir</i> for
1831, there is an agreeable paper of fifteen pages
entitled <i>Some Passages in the History of Sarah Curran</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
signed “M.” It has been conjectured that the
writer was one of the Crawfords of Lismore, who
had been very kind to Sarah when her mother’s flight
broke up the Curran household. Whoever “M.”
was, her devotion to her friend, of whose character
and mental qualities she had the highest opinion, is
conspicuous, and one may glean much information
from what she has to tell us. Captain Sturgeon,
she says in the slightly stilted Georgian phrases, was
everything which is good. “Had not her heart
been seared by early grief and disappointment, he
could not have failed to have experienced the most
flattering reception.” Sarah herself was entirely
open with him: one would expect no less of her
nobly sweet nature. “She pleaded his own cause
for him by proving how little he deserved a divided
affection;” but “the constancy and tenderness of
her attachment to Emmet seem only to have rendered
her the more interesting.” Two difficult years and
more went by for Henry Sturgeon. He never
wavered in his purpose: much as society sought
after him, there was but one woman in the world to
that patient and dedicated lover. Time was on their
side. Sarah was gaining some measure of content
and also of health, although she never definitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
rallied from the heartbreak of 1803. It touched
her at last that as she was, as she had told him so
often that she was, with no life to live and nothing to
give him, he prayed her still to become his wife, to
lend him the one ultimate privilege of humblest
service, from which otherwise he would be debarred.
Some expectation of leaving the south of Ireland, or
the actual arrival of orders from headquarters, seems
to have lent a sudden heightened earnestness to his
addresses; and Sarah, being pressed, gave her sad
consent. They were married at Glanmire Church,
near Woodhill, in the February of 1806.</p>

<p>A dismal wedding it must have been! “M.”
was told by one of the bridesmaids, long after, of
the melancholy drive in the closed carriage, with the
bride in tears. For a time Captain Sturgeon’s
affairs kept him in England; then he was transported,
with his regiment, to Malta and Sicily.
The first journey, fully a half-year after the marriage,
must have taken him and his wife through
the capital, the Dublin of all racking memories, for
we hear of Mrs. Sturgeon visiting Mr. James
Petrie’s studio there. From the sketches he had
made of Robert Emmet in the court-room, and
from the mask in his possession, he had painted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
portrait unhappily not wholly successful. But we
know what peculiar interest belongs to a portrait,
when there is, and can be, but one; and no person,
surely, in all the world, can have longed to scan this
one with the longing of Sarah Sturgeon. Dr. William
Stokes, the biographer of George Petrie, says that
George, then the artist’s little son, happened to be
alone, playing in his father’s studio, when a veiled
lady entered and went over to the easel. He never
forgot her nor the moment. “She lifted her veil,
and stood long in unbroken silence, gazing at the
face before her; then suddenly turning, moved with
an unsteady step to another corner of the room, and
bending forwards, pressed her head against the wall,
heaving deep sobs, her whole form shaken with a
storm of passionate grief. How long that agony
lasted the boy could not tell; it appeared to him to be
an hour. Then with a supreme effort she controlled
herself, pulled down her veil, and quickly and
silently left the room. Years after, the boy learned
from his father that this was Sarah Curran, who
had come by appointment to see her dead lover’s
portrait, on the understanding that she should meet
no one of the family.”</p>

<p>Captain Sturgeon was glad of the duty which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
turned his face southwards, as he could not but
believe that the softer climate would help his frail
Sarah. It is curious that Moore, in making her the
unconscious heroine of his lovely lyric, should have
placed the scene of her abstracted singing “the
wild song of her dear native plains,” and of her
abstracted turning from “lovers around her sighing,”
in Italy! quite as if Captain Sturgeon, “curteis
and mylde, and the most soofering man that ever I
met withal,” had no existence. The poet, in all
probability, heard late of the incident, and thus
did not assign it to Woodhill. Only too accurate
was one foreboding stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Nor soon will the tear of his country be dried,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nor long will his love stay behind him.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But before 1808 set in, Sarah’s strength seemed
to be establishing itself in the kindly foreign air;
in that and in her growing happiness her husband
began to reap the moral reward he had so hardly
won. Abruptly, and not without alarm, the English
in Sicily were driven homewards by the descent of
the French on those shores. Captain and Mrs.
Sturgeon hurried aboard a crowded transport bound
for Portsmouth. The poor lady had great excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and considerable hardship to undergo, and in
the course of that most luckless voyage was prematurely
born her only child. The deep-seated
sadness of her soul, as if unjustly alienated from
her, returned in all its fulness after his death. She
settled with her husband at Hythe in Kent, and
there she made haste to die. The laburnums were
coming into blossom when she entered upon her
eternity, six-and-twenty years old. She had a meek
request to make of her father, who was oftentimes
as near to her new home as London: it was that
she might be buried in a garden grave at the Priory,
where the sister who died in childhood had been
laid. One need have no very romantic imagination
to guess that the remote green spot bordering the
lawn (a natural trysting-place screened by great trees
that grow near the little grave), was dear to her also
for another’s sake, for some old association with
him who loved her in his hunted youth. For his
own reasons, Mr. Curran, approached on the subject,
saw fit to refuse. During the first week of
May, 1808, Sir Charles Napier thus wrote his
mother: “I rode over to Hythe this morning to
see poor Sturgeon, who has lost his little wife at
last, the betrothed of Emmet. Young Curran is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
here: his sister was gone before his arrival. They
are going to take the body to Ireland.” It was
Richard Curran, faithful in every human relationship,
who went on to his brother-in-law. The
bereaved two brought Sarah home to her own
country, to the tomb in Newmarket of the grandmother
of whom she had been fond, and for whom
she was named: Sarah Philpot. The headstone was
prepared, and seen by some local antiquary, and
remembered; but it disappeared before it was
placed. Emmet’s love sleeps, like Emmet, without
an epitaph.</p>

<p>The letter which Richard Curran wrote to “M.”
about his dead sister was printed by her twenty-three
years after. In it was enclosed a fragment of
Sarah’s own:—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>: I know how heartily
you’ll participate in the feelings with which I
announce to you the death of your poor friend,
my lamented Sarah. I would willingly spare myself
this distressing office; but I cannot expose one
whom she so loved to the risk of stumbling inadvertently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in a public paper on a piece of intelligence
so affecting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wish also to convey to
you a testimony that her thoughts never strayed
from you, and that to the hour of her death you
were the object of her affection. The enclosed
unfinished letter is the last she ever wrote. In it
you will find a very mitigated statement of her
sufferings. I can anticipate the satisfaction you will
derive from the strong sense of religious impressions
which marks her letters; and I at the same time
congratulate and thank you for having cultivated
in her the seeds of that consoling confidence which
cheered her departing moments, and stripped death,
if not of its anguish, yet of its greatest horrors.
The hopes held out by her physicians were, alas!
more humane than well-grounded: she expired at
half-past five, on the morning of the 5th inst., of a
rapid decline. To describe my sorrow would be
but to write her eulogy. You know all the various
qualities with which she was so eminently gifted,
and the consequent pangs I must feel at so abrupt
and calamitous a dispensation. I am now on my
way, with her afflicted widower, accompanying her
remains, which she wished to lie in her native land.
I enclose you a lock of her hair; it was cut off after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
her death. Adieu, my dear madam. I make no
apology for this melancholy intrusion, and I beg to
assure you that one in whose acquirements and
disposition she found so much that was kindred to
her own, can never cease to be an object of most
respectful esteem and attachment to a brother that
loved her as I did.—I remain, your obliged friend
and humble servant,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Richard Curran</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear M——</span>: I suppose you do not know
of my arrival from Sicily, or I should have heard
from you. I must be very brief in my detail of the
events which have proved so fatal to me, and which
followed our departure from that country. A most
dreadful and perilous passage occasioning me many
frights, I was, on our entrance into the Channel,
prematurely delivered of a boy, without any assistance
save that of one of the soldiers’ wives, the only
woman on board except myself. The storm being
so high that no boat could stand out at sea, I was
in imminent danger till twelve next day, when at
the risk of his life a physician came on board from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
one of the other ships, and relieved me. The storm
continued, and I got a brain fever, which, however,
passed off. To be short: on landing at Portsmouth,
the precious creature for whom I had
suffered so much God took to Himself. The inexpressible
anguish I felt at this event, preying on
me, has occasioned the decay of my health. For
the last month the contest between life and death
has seemed doubtful; but this day, having called
in a very clever man here, he seems not to think me
in danger. My disorder is a total derangement of
the nervous system, and its most dreadful effects I
find in the attack on my mind and spirits. I suffer
misery you cannot conceive. I am often seized with
icy perspirations, trembling, and that indescribable
horror which you must know, if you have ever had
the fever. Write instantly to me. Alas, I want
everything to soothe my mind. O my friend!
would to Heaven you were with me: nothing so
much as the presence of a dear female friend would
tend to my recovery. But in England you know
how I am situated: not one I know intimately. To
make up for this, my beloved husband is everything
to me. His conduct, throughout all my troubles,
surpasses all praise. Write to me, dear M——, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
tell me how to bear all these things. I have, truly
speaking, cast all my care on the Lord; but ah, how
our weak natures fail; every day, every hour, I may
say. On board the ship, when all seemed adverse
to hope, it is strange how an overstrained trust in
certain words of our Saviour gave me such perfect
faith in His help, that although my baby was visibly
pining away, I never doubted his life for a moment.
‘He who gathers the lambs in His arms,’ I thought,
would look down on mine, if I had faith in Him.
This has often troubled me since——”</p></div>

<p>Richard Curran, who took pains to send that broken
letter to a woman who valued it above fine gold, was
always a good brother. Concerning his dear Sarah he
had to be reticent, too, in reticent company. A lady
who knew W. Henry Curran long and well, heard him
mention his youngest sister only once. They were
searching for something in a garret, when an exquisite
picture standing laced with cobwebs, the
picture of a girl about eighteen, caught her eye.
“My sister Sarah, by Romney,” Henry said shortly,
seeing that he had to say something. “Family
pride had been deeply hurt by the publicity attached
to poor Sarah’s unfortunate love-episode.” The
Romney, sold by auction when Henry Curran died,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
is now the property of the Hon. Gerald Ponsonby;
it has been beautifully engraved for Miss Frances
A. Gerard’s <i>Some Fair Hibernians</i>, 1897. The
delicately powdered hair, the low frilled dress with
the line of black velvet about the neck, the gracious
shoulders, the purely Irish mouth and eyes, half-scornful
of life, half-resigned to it, which never
knew illusion, and can never know abiding joy—-these
are most tenderly painted, and remain among
the things one does not forget. The last word of
this haunting personality shall be loyal “M.’s”:—</p>

<p>“In person Mrs. Sturgeon was about the ordinary
size, her hair and eyes black. Her complexion was
fairer than is usual with black hair, and was a little
freckled. Her eyes were large, soft, and brilliant,
and capable of the greatest variety of expression.
Her aspect in general indicated reflection, and pensive
abstraction from the scene around her. Her wit
was keen and playful, but chastised [<i>sic</i>]; although
no one had a quicker perception of humour or
ridicule. Her musical talents were of the first
order: she sang with exquisite taste. I think I
never heard so harmonious a voice.”</p>

<p>As for Captain Henry Sturgeon, he only betook
himself anew to his post. His more active military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
career was now to begin. Throughout the Peninsular
War he served as Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel, and
later as Colonel of South Guides on the Duke of
Wellington’s staff; and Wellington’s despatches
ring again and again with his commended name.
Riding across a vineyard during the fight near Vie
Begorre, on a March morning of 1814, in the sixth
year of his widowerhood, and the thirty-second of
his age, he was shot dead in the saddle. He never
had his dues in a profession where official recognition
was then not stinted; and perhaps he cared
little that it was so. <i>The Dictionary of National
Biography</i>, which does not mention his all-significant
marriage, yet quotes from <i>The War in the
Peninsula</i> what is said of Henry Sturgeon: “Skilled
to excellence in almost every branch of war, and
possessing a variety of accomplishments, he used his
gifts so gently for himself and so usefully for the
service that envy offered no bar to admiration, and
the whole army felt painfully mortified that his
merits were passed unnoticed.” This is one comrade’s
glowing praise of another. Has it gone
unguessed, the cause of the neglect at home of one
of the most brilliant and devoted officers of his
generation? Can the cause be hidden from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
who have scrutinised the Government of that day,
with its spites, its partisanships, its incapacity for
distant outlooks, its severance from ideals? This
Englishman, whatever his eminence of courage and
skill might be, had been the husband of Emmet’s
sweetheart; and Emmet was an Irish rebel and felon.
The young soldier had probably weighed well what
he was inheriting, before his marriage, and found all
that endurable enough, until he died. In a world
where earthly accidents wither away at a breath, and
men of like temper see each other as they are, Henry
Sturgeon must have smiled from the blood-wet
Spanish grass straight into Robert Emmet’s eyes.</p>

<p>One likes the unexpected epilogue, as one likes
the mournful play. It is all satisfactory: “nothing
but well and fair, and what may quiet us,” in the
odd pattern of the plot. Emmet lives in it, and
outlives. It is the compensation of a lot cast in a
planet where even our own honourable action has a
trick of turning hostile and smearing us, that there
is something in the best of us which cannot be
smeared. Robert Emmet’s large soul has, like a
magician, pieced together his broken body, the
symbol of his broken, mistimed, and because mistimed,
unhallowed effort. But only his own soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
has done it, and by a power within, shaking herself
clear of censure. Mr. Henry Curran devotes to
him a reticent paragraph obliquely affectionate.
“He met his fate with unostentatious fortitude;
and although few could ever think of justifying his
projects or regretting their failure, yet his youth, his
talents, the great respectability of his connections,
and the evident delusion of which he was the victim,
have excited more general sympathy for his unfortunate
end, and more forbearance towards his
memory, than are usually extended to the errors or
sufferings of political offenders.” At the end of a
hundred years, the feelings which may temperately
be described as sympathy and forbearance do survive,
ranged on the side of this political offender; but is
it to be thought for a moment that five-and-twenty
years of life, intellectuality, social standing, above
all the capacity for being fooled (adorable as that
may sometimes be), are alone able to commend any
man to the remembrance of posterity? No: to
dominate a moral distance there must be moral
height. Emmet was magnanimous. The word was
nobly applied to him by Lord Hardwicke, the head
of the Government which hanged and beheaded him.
Now to be magnanimous is not to possess a definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
grace or virtue: magnanimity, like a sense of humour,
is a spirit, a solvent merely; to exercise it in any
one emergency is to show greatness equal to all.
Robert Emmet said that he had received, immediately
on his return from France, official invitations from
conspirators in high quarters at home: the “first
men in the land” were those who “invited him over.”
Of his truthfulness there was but one opinion.
Said Curran, who loved him little: “I would have
believed the word of Emmet as soon as the oath
of any other man I ever knew.” The Attorney-General
at the trial referred to the prisoner as “a
gentleman to whom the rebellion may be traced, as
the origin, life, and soul of it.” This was Emmet’s
reply, when, after nightfall, his turn came to speak:
“My lords, let me here observe that I am not the
head and lifeblood of this rebellion. When I came
to Ireland I found the business ripe for execution:
I was asked to join in it.” And again: “I have
been charged with that importance in the efforts to
emancipate my country as to be considered the keystone
of the combination of Irishmen, or, as it has
been expressed, the life and soul of this conspiracy.
You do me honour overmuch. You have given to
the subaltern all the credit of the superior.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
turned half-smiling to the presiding judge. “There
are men concerned in this conspiracy who are not
only superior to me, but even to your own conception
of yourself, my lord.” At the final moment
of his life Emmet stood motionless with a handkerchief
in his hand, the fall of which was to be the
signal for the cart to be drawn away. To the
usual “Are you ready, sir?” he twice answered
“No.” As it was, another and obeyed signal was
impatiently given before he had dropped the handkerchief.
Why did he hesitate? Was he perhaps
expecting these concealed associates, his leaders and
long-silent abettors, to reprieve or rescue him? So
romantic a fancy, implying so much belief in human
generosity, was only too natural to Robert Emmet.
Many thinking heads, even under coronets, had been
hot for reform in that unfavourable hour; there
were many who desired the removal of religious
disabilities, popular representation in Parliament,
death to the vile system of local laws under which
one witness, and only one witness, was sufficient to
convict a man of high treason. Reform being disallowed,
they declared themselves eloquently as ready
to be driven to armed resistance against England:
that is, towards total divorce and reconstruction. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
poor Emmet alone, the thing so unavoidable which
was good enough to long for and to talk about, was
the thing good enough to do. The “first in the
land” kept their heads; and in death as in life he
kept their secret. There is a great unwritten chapter
of perfidy behind his lonely ineffectual blow struck
for national freedom. Anyone who has studied well
these events of 1803, and weighed well the astonishing
confidential information about the historical
papers at Dublin Castle, which was given not long
ago to Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet, of New York,
by Sir Bernard Burke, and incorporated in <i>The
Emmet Family</i>, can hardly doubt that revelations
on that subject are yet to come which will lengthen
the story of Mr. Pitt, Lord Castlereagh, Mr. Under-Secretary
Marsden, and their dealings with Ireland.
And English gold and English terrorism had too
truly won their way at last with Emmet’s humble
colleagues at home.</p>

<p>There are minor instances of Emmet’s magnanimity
no less striking in their way. “We are all
Protestants!” he said in a delighted and congratulatory
spirit to Russell, implicated with him; he
could not forget how much more heavily suspicion
would bear upon those others yet shackled by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
penal laws. To this beautiful inborn openness of
mind was due his allusion before Lord Norbury (a
judge as well-hated as Jeffreys, and for much the
same reasons), to “that tyranny of which you are
only the intermediate minister.” From his cell,
within a few hours of the end, he sent a manly
letter of thanks to the Chief Secretary, in which he
addresses him thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Had I been permitted to proceed with my
vindication, it was my intention not only to have
acknowledged the delicacy with which (I feel with
gratitude) I have been personally treated, but also
to have done the most public justice to the mildness
of the present Administration in this country; and
at the same time to have acquitted them, as far as
rested with me, of any charge of remissness in not
having previously detected a conspiracy, which,
from its closeness, I know it was impossible to have
done. I confess that I should have preferred this
mode if it had been permitted, as it would thereby
have enabled me to clear myself from an imputation
under which I might in consequence lie, and to
have stated why such an Administration did not
prevent, but (under the peculiar situation of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
country) perhaps rather accelerated my determination
to make some effort for the overthrow of a
Government of which I do not think equally highly.
However, as I have been deprived of that opportunity,
I think it right now to make an acknowledgment
which justice requires from me as a man, and
which I do not feel to be in the least derogatory
from my decided principles as an Irishman.—I have
the honour to be, sir, with the greatest respect, your
most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="sig">
“<span class="smcap">Robt. Emmet</span>.”<br />
</p>

<p>(Hard. MS. 35,742, f. 196.)</p></div>

<p>The Lord Lieutenant makes a comment on this,
in that letter to his brother, the Home Secretary,
from which much has already been cited:—</p>

<p>“I enclose copies of two letters which he wrote
this morning [September 20, 1803]. One of the
acts of kindness to which he particularly refers, in
his letter to Mr. Wickham, was his being removed
from the cell at Newgate, in which he had been
placed after the sentence, to his former apartment
at Kilmainham, as had been originally intended.
He had alluded to this in his conversation with the
clergymen, and admitted that the general conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of those who administered the Government was
likely to conciliate the people, though he did not
approve the form of the Government and the
British connection, both of which he had been
desirous to overthrow.”</p>

<p>In regard to this forwarded letter, the Home
Secretary utters his congratulatory mind, and gives
his opinion of our hero:—</p>

<p>“At the same time that one cannot but deplore
the wicked malignity and wonder at the enthusiastic
wildness which appears to have actuated the conduct
of this miserable man, one cannot but admire the
judgment, the temper, and delicacy which appear to
have been manifested in the conduct of your Excellency’s
Government towards this person, and all
concerned or in any manner connected with him.
I cannot but take advantage of this occasion to
express the satisfaction I feel in observing that the
justice, moderation, and mildness of your Excellency’s
Government have extorted even from a
condemned traitor the same sentiments of respect
and reverence which we have been accustomed to
hear from the loyal part of the community.”</p>

<p>It does not seem to have been revealed to the
Hon. Charles Yorke, that what “extorted” Emmet’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
assurances was his own extreme, almost fantastic,
chivalry; and that those assurances set off deeply
by contrast, as he vehemently meant they should do,
his abhorrence of the underlying system of which
Lord Hardwicke’s conduct was merely the agreeable
accident. Lord Hardwicke, at least, had understood.</p>

<p>Even one intelligent modern has fallen foul of
Emmet’s unusually scrupulous care in such matters,
and of his attitude of regal courtesy, like that of
the battling foes on Crécy field: such a care and
such an attitude indicate, it is thought, “weakness
of character!” What it really indicates is a diplomacy
so high that if generally practised it might
render human intercourse very difficult. We cannot
all be as Apollo Musagetes, daring to employ
nothing but the amenities, the major force, in a
universe inured to cheap thunderbolts. As Thoreau
shrewdly says: “The gods can never afford to have
a man in the world who is privy to any of their
secrets. They cannot have a spy here: they will at
once send him packing!”</p>

<p>A postulate of true magnanimity is modesty.
Emmet’s was unique. It is the testimony of John
Patten, who was well aware of his kinsman’s
immense self-reliance, that “Robert had not one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
particle of vanity in his composition. He was the
most free from conceit of any man I ever knew.
You might live with him for years .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and never
discover that he thought about himself at all. He
was vain neither of his person nor of his mind.”
La Comtesse d’Haussonville cannot refrain, in her
graceful memoir, from contrasting him with another
excellent youth of genius, André Chénier, who very
properly expressed his pang of self-pity in face of
the guillotine. “<i>Et pourtant</i>,” he cried, striking his
forehead with that gesture of Gallic candour which
is so odd to us and so winning: “<i>et pourtant il y
avait quelque chose ici!</i>” <i>Il y avait quelque chose ici</i>
in Emmet too, although it was not great lyric
poetry. He had almost every other capacity.
The Rev. Archibald Douglas, in his old age, when
Robert Emmet had been nearly forty years in his
grave, summed up his conviction about him to
Dr. R. R. Madden: “So gifted a creature does not
appear once in a thousand years.”</p>

<p>We have no portrait of Emmet which antedates
his trial. Three artists in good repute sketched
him, that day, on bits of waste paper or else on the
backs of envelopes, and did it surreptitiously for
dread of prohibition: these were Comerford, Brocas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and James Petrie. The two first, viewing Emmet
in profile, gained better results than the third; yet
Petrie’s drawing serves as the basis of the only well-known
engraved pictures. It was Petrie, moreover,
who was allowed to take the death-mask of
Robert Emmet. The good material accumulated
was put to no very memorable use. The Petrie
Emmet is somewhat heavy and glowering, and
distinctly wry-necked. It is meant, in fact, to be
impressive; and the note of artificiality disqualifies
it as a true representation of its subject, a man of
shynesses and simplicities. Comerford, on the other
hand, and Brocas, as effectively, have given us a
face to look at which one instinctively believes in.
It is stamped with concentration and resolve, but
has in it something serene and gentle and sweet,
and it harmonises with all we can learn of Emmet’s
physical appearance from the printed page. He
was about five feet seven inches in height, wiry,
slender, erect, healthy, full of endurance, quick
of movement. His dark eyes were small and
rather deep-set, and sparkling with expression; his
nose was straight and thin, his mouth delicately
chiselled. He had the powerful chin and jaw-bone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
never absent from the bodily semblance of a strong-willed
personality. The fine pendulous hair bespoke
the enthusiast, but it was not worn long save over
the forehead, which was noticeably broad and high.
What gave a faun-like idiosyncrasy to the whole
countenance was the slight upward curve of the
perfect eyebrows at the inner edge. If we are to
accept Brocas as our best authority (though his
hand at work has somehow captured a momentary
scorn not seen by Comerford), this idiosyncrasy
had in it no touch of frowning severity such as was
foreign, according to all report, to Emmet, but
added rather a final whimsical attraction to a sad
young face which a child or a dog would readily
love. As Anne Devlin said once of “Miss Sarah’s,”
it was “not handsome, but more than handsome.”
The one face it resembles is the Giotto Dante.</p>

<p>Some critics on the spindle side will find it
easier to forgive an unsuccessful patriot than an
uninventive and unauthoritative lover. Emmet in
hiding near the Priory, between the no-rising and
the arrest, had his almost certain chances of escape;
but he could not persuade the girl, born, like
Hamlet, to a tragic inaction, to strike hands with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
him and make the dash for liberty. Habit sat too
heavily on her defrauded spirit, and insufficient
faith in herself kept her where she was. The
secrecy of their relations seems to have hurt and
weakened her. She could no more stand up then
against her father’s displeasure than she could part
long after with dejection and a sort of remorse,
when the face of her outer world had beautifully,
almost miraculously, changed. And Emmet loved
her as she was, a day-lily on a drooping stem. To
quarrel with them because no fleet-footed horse, as
in a novel, pranced by night to Rathfarnham to bear
them away together, is to quarrel with a perfected
sequence. To mark the look of this Robert,
hungry for the heroic, the look of this Sarah,
mystical as twilight, is but to forecast casualties.
Perhaps as every soul has a right to its own kind
of welfare and happiness, so it has a right to its
own kind of sorrow. The second alternative suits
the innocent, although it shocks the moral sense
of most persons far more than would the choice
of error instead of truth. To be an Emmet at
all meant to get into trouble for advanced ideals.
To be a Curran meant to have a keen intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
always besieged hard, and eventually overcome, by
melancholia, as John Philpot Curran’s was at the
end, as Richard Curran’s was in his prime. Emmet
and the young creature of his adoration were hardly
used; but Fate chose not ill for them. A <i>révolution
manquée</i> with an elopement; expatriation with a
marriage certificate; a change of political front with
the parental blessing—all look somehow equally
incongruous and out of key with those sensitive
faces elected, let us say, to better things. Their
story, with all deductions which can be made, has
already done something to deepen the sense of
human love in the world, and to broaden the dream
of human liberty. Perhaps either of those games
may be considered as always worth the candle.</p>

<p>Rashness, and the immediate ruin consequent upon
it, two things which men can taste, smell, handle,
hear, and see, are not redeemed, in their opinion,
by anything so unsubstantial as motive. History, a
tissue of externals, cannot afford to take account of
that. Hence it falls out that certain spirits are
finally given over, with their illegitimate deeds in
arm, to folk-lore and balladry. Of these are
Charlotte Corday, and John Brown of Ossawatomie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and Robert Emmet. There is no need of exculpating
them in the forum of the people, where they
were never held to be at fault; and exculpation is a
waste of words to the rest of us. We understand
too well what social havoc these pure-eyed hot-hearted
angels bring in their wake, when they condescend
to interfere with our fixed affairs. They
call into being in their own despite our most self-protective
measures: measures, in short, which
amount to an international coalition against the
undesirable immigrant. Relentless inhospitality to
such innovators, in every generation and in every
clime, is the habit of this planet. Such as our
affairs are, we do not seem to wish them made over
into duplicates of those of the Kingdom of Heaven.
The executed meddlers, however, often take on an
unaccountable posthumous grace, and may even be
approached upon anniversaries in a mood none other
than that of affectionate congratulation. The
anomaly of our own situation has passed with their
death: though they never change, we grow up in
time to be Posterity, and to see with them the
ultimate correlations of things, in a region of intellectual
space where nothing goes by its old name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
To be unbiassed and Irish is to love Robert Emmet;
to be generously English is to love him; to be
American is to love him anyhow.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
